\chapter*{Abstract}
Abstract goes here

% Paragraph 1: What is the problem?
% - Not more than 3-4 sentences telling the reader what the problem is, in as simple English as possible

% Paragraph 2: Why is the problem hard?
% - What has eluded us in solving it?
% - What does the literature say about this problem?
% - What are the obstacles/challenges? Why is it non-trivial?

% Paragraph 3: What is your approach/result to solving this problem?
% - How come you solved it?
% - Think of this as your “startling” or “sit up and take notice” claims that your thesis will plan to prove/demonstrate

% Paragraph 4: What is the consequence of your approach?
% - So, now that you’ve made me sit up and take notice, what is the impact?
% - What does your approach/result enable?
