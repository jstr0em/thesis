Outline of the paper:

Introduction:
- Background/perspective on indoor air quality and VI

- Temporal & spatial variability in VI

- Overcoming variability
-- Techniques/methods; CPM, ITS, etc.
-- Problems with this approach (buildings respond differently to same stimuli)
-- Need better mechanistic understanding o VI to effectively use these (common thread is they seek to use or manipulate external variable for certain outcome.)

- Modeling for understanding VI
-- Background/past applications
-- Brief description of what they can model?
-- Allow us to understand physical mechanism

- Sorption & VI
-- Presented as another issue with unknown consequences
-- Combined model & experimental effort

- Outline
-- Basically this but in words!

Methods:
- Introduction
-- More detailed history of modeling
--- Prominent models/developments
-- Limitations of many of these models (including ours)

- Model methodology
-- CSM description & how to model this
-- Soil moisture
-- Darcy's law
-- Contaminant transport
-- Indoor air modeling

- FEM
-- Brief description
-- Why we pick it/benefits/advantages
-- Limitations
-- COMSOL
-- Considerations
--- Geometry generation
--- Meshing
--- Solver settings (?)
