\section{Soil Physics Governing Vapor Intrusion}\label{sec:soil_domain}

The soil surrounding the structure in our VI model is, unlike the indoor environment, modeled explicitly.
In this section we will walk through each physics, the associated governing equation, and boundary conditions required to model the contaminant transport in soil.
The following physics and governing equations will be covered:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Water flow in unsaturated porous media
  \item Vapor transport in unsaturated porous media
  \item Mass transport in partially saturated medium
\end{enumerate}
In addition to these, the modeling of the temperature distribution in the soil is covered in Appendix .\par % TODO: Reference the appendix once it exists.

The vapor contaminant transport through the soil in VI occurs through the vadose zone - soil that is partially filled with water, giving a three-phase transport system.
This partial water content has profound effects on both advective and diffusive transport and modeling the water content is achieved via \textit{Richard's equation}.
Since the vapor and mass transport in the soil are so dependent on the soil water content, it is covered first in the following section \ref{sec:richards}.\par

The mass transport in the soil has both an advective and diffusive component.
The advective transport in the soil is dictated by the vapor flow in the soil which is described by \textit{Darcy's Law} making it the next logical step to cover in section \ref{sec:darcys}.
The diffusive transport depends on the contaminant vapor concentration itself and accurately modeling this requires coupling with all of the physics discussed so far (including the indoor environment).
Therefore the mass transport physics, governed by the \textit{advection-diffusion equation} will be covered last in section \ref{sec:mass_transport}.\par
% TODO: Fix this so that you don't need to switch paths here. Ideally just reformatting the whole thing.
