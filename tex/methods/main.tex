% TODO: Restructure to reflect the COMSOL workflow
% - Keep main body simple
% - Use appendices as building/lego blocks to add complexity, e.g. one appendix about how to model a PP, and just that.

\begin{comment}
Things to bring up:

- Why is it beneficial to model VI?


- Background on modeling in VI research
-- History & modeling applications
-- Limitations of other people's models
* Should this come before or after my mathematical description of VI?

- Mathematical description of VI modeling
* Start with a non-technical description of a CSM and the processes/physics underlying it. A nice graph showing all of it (including labeled physics and fluxes) would be nice.

- Short description of FEM
-- COMSOL
-- Basic mathematical concept
-- Advantages/disadvantages of this approach compared to others, i.e. why pick FEM over other numerical schemes?
-- Meshing
