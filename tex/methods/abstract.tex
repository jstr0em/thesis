In this chapter we develop and solve a numerical model that simulate vapor intrusion (VI) at a house overlying a contaminated groundwater source; the purpose of which is to introduce VI modeling and the necessary fundamentals to how models are used in this work.
The physics and associated governing equations required to model this scenario are presented, as well as the necessary initial and boundary conditions to solve these equations.
This model is solved using the finite element method (FEM), which is briefly described, and this choice discussed.
Practical considerations of implementing a FEM model are covered - including geometry and mesh generation, solver configuration, and post-processing of results.
