\section{Vapor Intrusion Physics and Governing Equations}

Throughout this section the books \textit{Contaminant hydrogeology}\cite{fetter_contaminant_1993} by Fetter, and \textit{Dynamics of fluids in porous media}\cite{bear_dynamics_1972} by Bear are used as sources, especially on topics regarding soil physics and contaminant transport in soils.
The COMSOL reference manuals\cite{comsol_comsol_nodate,comsol_subsurface_nodate} are also used as sources.
