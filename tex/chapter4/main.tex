Main point of this chapter:

Demonstrate how and why subsurface preferential pathways can have such a significant effect on VI.

Outline:

Introduction:
* How did we come to find out about PP?
* Why should we care about them?
* How do they work?

Methods:
* How do we model the PP?

Results & Discussion:

* Show how the model predicts the VI at the ASU house. (Main case)
* Turn on and off the enhanced advective potential and contaminant availability to show their contributions.
* Some other factors that affect PP "performance" in the main case. I.e. effect of gravel sub-base.


Conclusion:
* PPs need to enhance advective transport and introduce extra contaminants to be impactful (plus other factors). How common place these combination of factors are determine the concern for PPs.
* Suggestions for how to deal/uncover PPs? Follow Danish recommendations. See if subsurface piping may be discovered a priori. Sample nearby manholes (likely to play some role). Might even use CPM.
