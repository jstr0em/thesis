  abstract = {Steady-state vapor intrusion scenarios involving aerobically biodegradable chemicals are studied using a three-dimensional multicomponent numerical model. In these scenarios, sources of aerobically biodegradable chemical vapors are placed at depths of 1-14 m beneath a 10 m \texttimes{} 10 m basement or slab-on-grade construction building, and the simultaneous transport and reaction of hydrocarbon and oxygen vapors are simulated. The results are presented as Johnson and Ettinger attenuation factors {$\alpha$} (predicted indoor air hydrocarbon concentration/source vapor concentration), and normalized contour plots of hydrocarbon and oxygen concentrations. In addition to varying the vapor source depth, the effects of source concentration (2-200 mg chemical/L vapor) and oxygen-limited first-order reaction rates (0.018-1.8 h-1) are studied. Hydrocarbon inputs were specific to benzene, although the relevant properties are similar to those for a range of hydrocarbons of interest. Overall, the results suggest that aerobic biodegradation could play a significant role in reducing vapor intrusion into buildings (decreased {$\alpha$}-values) relative to the no-biodegradation case, with the significance of aerobic biodegradation increasing with increasing vapor source depth, decreasing vapor source concentration, and increasing first-order biodegradation rate. In contrast to the no-biodegradation case, differences in foundation construction can be significant in some settings. The significance of aerobic biodegradation is directly related to the extent to which oxygen is capable of migrating beneath the foundation. For example, in the case of a basement scenario with a 200 mg/L vapor source located at 3 m bgs, oxygen is consumed before it can migrate beneath the foundation, so the attenuation factors for simulations with and without aerobic biodegradation are similar for all first-order rates studied. For the case of a 2 mg/L vapor source located at 8 m bgs, the oxygen is widely distributed beneath the foundation, and the attenuation factor for the biodegradation case ranges from about 3 to 18 orders-of-magnitude less than that for the no-biodegradation case.},

The time required for sorption to reach near-steady-state conditions at sites may take months or years to achieve. This study investigated the vapor phase attenuation of trichloroethylene (TCE) in five soils varying widely in clay and organic matter content using repacked columns. The primary indicators of TCE sorption were vapor retardation rate (Rt), the time required for the TCE vapor to pass through the soil column, and specific volume of retention (VR), and total volume of TCE retained in soil. Results show TCE vapor retardation is mainly due to the rapid partitioning of the compound to SOM. However, the specific volume of retention of clayey soils with secondary mineral particles was higher. Linear regression analyses of the SOM and clay fraction with VR show that a unit increase in clay fraction results in higher sorption of TCE (VR) than the SOM. However, partitioning of TCE vapor was not consistent with the samples' surface areas but was mainly a function of the type of secondary minerals present in soils.},

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Research Park site, located in Moffett Field, CA, and comprised of 213 acres, is being planned for redevelopment as a collaborative research and educational campus with associated facilities. Groundwater contaminated with hydrocarbon and halogenated hydro-carbon volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is the primary environmental medium of concern at the site. Over a 15-month period, approximately 1000 indoor, outdoor ambient, and outdoor ambient background samples were collected from four buildings designated as historical landmarks using Summa canisters and analyzed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency TO-15 selective ion mode. Both 24-hr and sequential 8-hr samples were collected. Comparison of daily sampling results relative to daily background results indicates that the measured trichloroethylene (TCE) concentrations were primarily due to the subsurface vapor intrusion pathway, although there is likely some contribution due to infiltration of TCE from the outdoor ambient background concentrations. Analysis of the cis-1,2-dichloroethylene concentrations relative to TCE concentrations with respect to indoor air concentrations and the background air support this hypothesis; however, this indicates that relative contributions of the vapor intrusion and infiltration pathways vary with each building. Indoor TCE concentrations were also compared with indoor benzene and background benzene concentrations. These data indicate significant correlation between background benzene concentrations and the concentration of benzene in the indoor air, indicating benzene was present in the indoor air primarily through infiltration of outdoor air into the indoor space. By comparison, measured TCE indoor air concentrations showed a significantly different relationship to background concentrations. Analysis of the results show that indoor air samples can be used to definitively define the source of the TCE present in the indoor air space of large industrial buildings.},

  abstract = {One of the goals of the French national campaign called ``Etablissements Sensibles (Sensitive Establishments)'' is to evaluate indoor air degradation in schools because of vapor intrusion of volatile compounds from soil gases towards the indoor air, related to the presence of former industrial sites on or near the establishment. During this campaign, as recommended by the United States of Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), indoor air quality was evaluated from soil gas concentrations using generic attenuation factors, and extra investigations into soil gases and indoor air were performed when the estimated values exceeded target indoor air concentrations. This study exploits matched data on subsurface soil gases and indoor air that came from the ``Sensitive Establishments'' campaign. It aims to consolidate and refine the use of attenuation factors as a function of environmental variables acquired routinely during environmental assessments. We have been able to select the measured environmental variables that have the most influence on vapor intrusion using Principal Components Analysis and hypotheses tests. Since the collected data are mainly related to weak sources (only 15\% schools required risk management measures related to vapor intrusion), halogenated volatile organic compounds (HVOC) were selected as tracer compounds for vapor intrusion for this study. This choice enables the exclusion or minimization of background sources contributions. From the results we have calculated the descriptive statistics of the attenuation factors distribution for the subslab-to-indoor air pathway and refined the attenuation factors for this pathway through an easily obtained parameter, building age. Qualitative comparison of attenuation factors according to the building age shows that attenuation factors observed for building less than 50 years are lower than attenuation factors for buildings 50 years old and above. These results show the utility of creating databases for consolidating and refining attenuation factors and therefore improving their use.},

  abstract = {The vapor intrusion impacts associated with the presence of chlorinated volatile organic contaminant plumes in the ground water beneath residential areas in Colorado and New York have been the subject of extensive site investigations and structure sampling efforts. Large data sets of ground water and indoor air monitoring data collected over a decade-long monitoring program at the Redfield, Colorado, site and monthly ground water and structure monitoring data collected over a 19-month period from structures in New York State are analyzed to illustrate the temporal and spatial distributions in the concentration of volatile organic compounds that one may encounter when evaluating the potential for exposures due to vapor intrusion. The analysis of these data demonstrates that although the areal extent of structures impacted by vapor intrusion mirrors the areal extent of chlorinated volatile organic compounds in the ground water, not all structures above the plume will be impacted. It also highlights the fact that measured concentrations of volatile organic compounds in the indoor air and subslab vapor can vary considerably from month to month and season to season. Sampling results from any one location at any given point in time cannot be expected to represent the range of conditions that may exist at neighboring locations or at other times. Recognition of this variability is important when designing sampling plans and risk management programs to address the vapor intrusion pathway.},

  abstract = {Vapor intrusion (VI) pathway assessment and data interpretation have been guided by an historical conceptual model in which vapors originating from contaminated soil or groundwater diffuse upward through soil and are swept into a building by soil gas flow induced by building underpressurization. Recent studies reveal that alternative VI pathways involving neighborhood sewers, land drains, and other major underground piping can also be significant VI contributors, even to buildings beyond the delineated footprint of soil and groundwater contamination. This work illustrates how controlled-pressure-method testing (CPM), soil gas sampling, and screening-level emissions calculations can be used to identify significant alternative VI pathways that might go undetected by conventional sampling under natural conditions at some sites. The combined utility of these tools is shown through data collected at a long-term study house, where a significant alternative VI pathway was discovered and altered so that it could be manipulated to be on or off. Data collected during periods of natural and CPM conditions show that the alternative pathway was significant, but its presence was not identifiable under natural conditions; it was identified under CPM conditions when measured emission rates were 2 orders of magnitude greater than screening-model estimates and subfoundation vertical soil gas profiles changed and were no longer consistent with the conventional VI conceptual model.},

When they are discovered during pre-sampling inspection, indoor sources are removed and air sampling is delayed, with the assumption that a few hours to a few days are sufficient for indoor source impacts to dissipate. This assumption was tested through the controlled release of SF6 and its monitoring in indoor air and soil gas at a study house over 2 years. Results show that indoor sources generate subsurface soil gas clouds as a result of fluctuating direction in the exchange between soil gas and indoor air and that it may take days to weeks under natural conditions for a soil gas cloud beneath a building to dissipate following indoor source removal. The data also reveal temporal variability in indoor air and soil gas concentrations, long-term seasonal patterns, and dissipation of soil gas clouds over days to weeks following source removal. Preliminary modeling results for similar conditions are consistent field observations. If representative of other sites, these results suggest that a typical 1-3 day waiting period following indoor source removal may not be sufficient to avoid confounding data and erroneous conclusions regarding VI occurrence.},

This study collected a long-term and high-frequency data set that can be used to assess indoor air sampling strategies for answering key pathway assessment questions like: ``Is VI occurring?'', and ``Will VI impacts exceed thresholds of concern?''. Indoor air sampling was conducted for 2.5 years at 2\textendash{}4 h intervals in a house overlying a dilute chlorinated solvent plume (10\textendash{}50 {$\mu$}g/L TCE). Indoor air concentrations varied by 3 orders of magnitude ({$<$}0.01\textendash{}10 ppbv TCE) with two recurring behaviors. The VI-active behavior, which was prevalent in fall, winter, and spring involved time-varying impacts intermixed with sporadic periods of inactivity; the VI-dormant behavior, which was prevalent in the summer, involved long periods of inactivity with sporadic VI impacts. These data were used to study outcomes of three simple sparse data sampling plans; the probabilities of false-negative and false-positive decisions were dependent on the ratio of the (action level/true mean of the data), the number of exceedances needed, and the sampling strategy. The analysis also suggested a significant potential for poor characterization of long-term mean concentrations with sparse sampling plans. The results point to a need for additional dense data sets and further investigation into the robustness of possible VI assessment paradigms.

For sites experiencing trichloroethylene (TCE) vapor intrusion, the potential for acute risks poses additional challenges, as the need for rapid response to exposure exceedances becomes critical in order to minimize health risks and associated liabilities. Continuous monitoring platforms have been deployed to monitor indoor and subsurface concentrations of key volatile constituents, atmospheric pressure, and pressure differential conditions that can result in advective transport. These systems can be comprised of multiplexed laboratory-grade analytical components integrated with telemetry and geographical information systems for automatically generating time-stamped renderings of observations and time-weighted averages through a cloud-based data management platform. Integrated automatic alerting and responses can also be engaged within one minute of risk exceedance detection. The objectives at a site selected for testing included continuous monitoring of vapor concentrations and related surface and subsurface physical parameters to understand exposure risks over space and time and to evaluate potential mechanisms controlling risk dynamics which could then be used to design a long-term risk reduction strategy. High-frequency data collection, processing, and automated visualization efforts have resulted in greater understanding of natural processes such as dynamic contaminant vapor intrusion risk conditions potentially influenced by localized barometric pumping induced by temperature changes. For the selected site, temporal correlation was observed between dynamic indoor TCE vapor concentration, barometric pressure, and pressure differential. This correlation was observed with a predictable daily frequency even for very slight diurnal changes in barometric pressure and associated pressure differentials measured between subslab and indoor regimes and suggests that advective vapor transport and intrusion can result in elevated indoor TCE concentrations well above risk levels even with low-to-modest pressure differentials. This indicates that vapor intrusion can occur in response to diurnal pressure dynamics in coastal regions and suggests that similar natural phenomenon may control vapor intrusion dynamics in other regions, exhibiting similar pressure, geochemical, hydrogeologic, and climatic conditions. While dynamic indoor TCE concentrations have been observed in this coastal environment, questions remain regarding whether this hydrogeologic and climatic setting represent a special case, and how best to determine when continuous monitoring should be required to most appropriately minimize exposure durations as early as possible. \textcopyright{}2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Although there have been several studies concerning the time variation of radon gas indoors, there have been few studies of the time variation of radon in the soil gas in the earth under or near an occupied house. Since the spring of 1993, the soil gas radon concentration was measured as a time series, at a depth of 1 m in three locations under and near a research house near Stockholm, along with indoor radon and environmental parameters. This report discusses the degree to which the house versus the weather interacts with and influences the soil gas radon concentration, and how much the influence of these two factors on the soil gas radon content varies with season and location. Strong correlations with barometric pressure and outdoor temperature occurred. The maximum soil gas concentrations occurred during the summer months and the minimum occurred during the winter, with the summer and winter levels differing by a factor of 2 to 3, depending on location. Changes in the 24-h averaged indoor radon concentration correlated well with the changes in the soil radon. The degree to which soil gas radon content may be used as an indicator of indoor radon contamination is discussed.},

In this work, the soil-gas distribution beneath and around a slab-on-grade building overlying shallow (0.5 to {$>$}1.5 m below ground surface) petroleum hydrocarbon\textendash{}impacted coarse alluvial soils was studied. The study spanned about 12 months, including the sampling of soil-gas hydrocarbon and oxygen concentrations, subslab soil vs. building pressure differentials and included weather conditions. Three-dimensional soil-gas concentration ``snapshots'' using samples from 79 soil-gas sampling points are presented here. Significant spatial variability was observed with hydrocarbon and oxygen concentrations ranging from about {$<$}0.01 to 200 mg/L and 0 to 21\% v/v, respectively. The presence of oxygen and the depth to petroleum-impacted soils appeared to be the dominant factors in controlling the soil-gas distribution; the depletion of hydrocarbons over short lateral and vertical distances ({$<$}2 m) was observed in the well-oxygenated regions. Composition data suggest preferential biodegradation of lighter compounds at some points, as reflected in the ratio of the masses of chemicals eluting on the gas chromatography between methane and pentane (C1 and C5) and all others after pentane ({$>$}C5).},

Results showed that the system provided rapid pressure field extension and radon control as much as 100 days of operation before optimum volatile organic compound (VOC) mitigation was achieved. Greater variability in VOC concentrations than in radon concentrations was observed during the initial mitigation system cycling. Subslab VOC concentrations at numerous locations increased during this initial period of SSD operation, and indoor air VOC concentrations were more variable than radon. However, indoor air concentrations were considerably less variable (and lower) during the first year of continuous mitigation system operation. \textcopyright{}2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

We have used a tracer study and VOC concentration measurements to evaluate the role of the combined sanitary/storm sewer line in VOC transport at the USEPA vapor intrusion research duplex in Indianapolis, Indiana. The results from the tracer study demonstrated gas migration from the sewer main line into the duplex. The migration pathway appears to be complex and may include leakage from the sewer lateral at a location below the building foundation. Vapor samples collected from the sewer line demonstrated the presence of tetrachloroethene (PCE) and chloroform in the sewer main in front of the duplex and at multiple sample locations within the sewer line upstream of the duplex. These test results combined with results from the prior multi-year study of the duplex indicate that the sewer line plays an important role in transport of VOCs from the subsurface source to the immediate vicinity of the duplex building envelope.},

Indoor materials can act as buffers for VOCs, reducing peak concentrations but prolonging the presence of compounds in the air. The purpose of this paper is to present quantitative experimental results on diffusion and sorption of VOCs in indoor materials and to discuss the impact of these processes on indoor air quality. A two-flow system was chosen for the present study because this method allows mass flow across materials to be directly observed. For some materials, effective diffusion coefficients were only 1 order of magnitude below what is found in air. Two types of concrete showed a very high sorption capacity for ethyl acetate. Steady-state calculations were performed within a model room. By considering various wall materials, the influences of diffusion and of sorption on the air quality of the room are discussed. Regarding the case of gypsum board walls, it may be concluded that diffusion through the material can contribute to reducing the room air concentration, especially at low ventilation rates. The results indicate that sorption and diffusion processes can affect the ventilation requirements in such rooms.},

Results are analogous to electrical circuit theory with resistors, including variable resistors or potentiometers, in parallel and series. This general approach lends itself particularly well to vapor intrusion calculations where there are multi-media compartments involving groundwater, soil, and air. In addition to showing that the model reduces to the well-known Johnson \& Ettinger model in limiting cases, we illustrate its simplicity and ease of use with several examples: (1) an example of how multiple partition coefficients collapse into a single partition coefficient illustrated by a three-phase problem involving tar, water, and air, (2) determination of when the presence of a basement significantly lowers first floor exposures, and (3) addition of diffusion in the saturated zone to the model to investigate whether the resistance associated with this compartment can be neglected. We conclude that if the water table is truly steady, this resistance would be very significant. Therefore, a vapor intrusion model that neglects both water table fluctuations and diffusion in groundwater is ignoring important physical phenomena.},

  abstract = {We describe the results of a five-month study during which 222Rn (radon) concentration, air- exchange (or ventilation) rate, and weather and radon source parameters were continuously monitored in a house near Chicago, with a view to accounting for the radon entry rate. The results suggest that the basement sump and perimeter drain-tile system played an important role in influencing the radon entry rate and that pressure-driven flow was more important than diffusion as a mechanism for radon entry. For the first 15 weeks of the study period the mean indoor radon concentration and air-exchange rate were 2.6pCi{$\mathscr{l}-$}1 (96 Bq m-3) and 0.22h-1, respectively; both parameters varied over a wide range. Radon concentration measured at the sump cover varied bimodally between 0 and 10 pCi{$\mathscr{l}-$}1 (0\textendash{}400 Bqm-3) and 300\textendash{}700 pCi{$\mathscr{l}-$}1 (10,000\textendash{}30,000 Bq m-3). These two modes corresponded well to periods of low and high indoor radon concentration; average indoor concentrations for these periods were 1.5 and 6.5 pCi{$\mathscr{l}-$}1 (55 and 240 Bq m-3), respectively. For data sorted into two groups according to radon activity at the sump, the indoor radon concentration showed little dependence on air-exchange rate. This result is accounted for by a model in which the radon entry rate, determined by mass balance, has two components\textemdash{}one diffusive, the other a pressure-driven flow component which is presumed to be proportional to the air-exchange rate. In fitting this model to the data we found that (1) the flow component dominated the diffusive component for periods of both high and low activity at the sump and (2) the magnitude of the diffusive component agreed well with the expected contributions of radon emanating from concrete and soil and diffusing into the house. To account for the flow component, we hypothesize that pressure drives air carrying a high concentration of radon generated in the soil, either through the bulk of the soil or along the outside of the basement walls, then into the basement through cracks and openings. During the final six weeks of the study, measurements were made with the water level in the sump maintained first below, then above the entrance of the pipe connected to the perimeter drain tile system. Average indoor radon concentrations during these two periods were 10.6 and 3.5 pCi{$\mathscr{l}-$}1 (390 and 130 Bq m-3), respectively. The relatively high latter value compared with the mean for the first 15 weeks, combined with the observation of intervals of high airborne alpha activity at the sump during this period, suggest that the level of water in the sump does not, by itself, account for the variation in alpha activity at the sump that we had previously observed. Fireplace operation substantially increased the air-exchange rate, but had only a small effect on indoor radon concentration, providing corroborative evidence that pressure-driven flow is an important mechanism for radon entry into this house.},

  abstract = {Investigations at former dry cleaning sites in Denmark show that sewer systems often are a major vapor intrusion pathway for chlorinated solvents to indoor air. In more than 20 percent of the contaminated drycleaner sites in Central Denmark Region, sewer systems were determined to be a major vapor intrusion pathway. Sewer systems can be a major intrusion pathway if contaminated groundwater intrudes into the sewer and contamination is transported within the sewer pipe by water flow in either free phase or dissolved states. Additionally, the contamination can volatilize from the water phase or soil gas can intrude the sewer system directly. In the sewer, the gas phase can migrate in any direction by convective transport or diffusion. Indications of the sewer as a major intrusion pathway are: higher concentrations in the upper floors in buildings, higher concentrations in indoor air than expected from soil gas measurements, higher concentrations in bathrooms/kitchen than in living rooms, chlorinated solvents in the sewer system, and a pressure gradient from the sewer system to indoor air. Measurements to detect whether or not the sewer system is an intrusion pathway are simple. In Central Denmark Region, the concentrations of contaminants are routinely measured in the indoor air at all floors, the outdoor air, behind the water traps in the building, and in the manholes close to the building. The indoor and outdoor air concentration, as well as concentrations in manholes, are measured by passive sampling on sorbent samplers over a 14-day period, and the measurements inside the sewer system are carried out by active sampling using carbon tubes (sorbent samplers). Furthermore, the pressure gradient over the building slab and between the indoor air and the sewer system are also measured. A simple test is depressurization of the sewer system. Using this technique, the pressure gradient between the sewer system and the indoor air is altered toward the sewer system\textemdash{}the contamination cannot enter the indoor air through the sewer system. If the sewer system is a major intrusion pathway, the effect of the test can be observed immediately in the indoor air. Remediation of a sewer transported contamination can be: prevention of the contaminants from intruding into the sewer system or prevention of the contaminated gas in the sewer system from intruding into the indoor air. Remediation techniques include the following: lining of the sewer piping to prevent the contamination from intruding into the sewer; sealing the sewer system in the building to prevent the contamination from the sewer system to intrude the indoor air; venting of manholes; and depressurizing the sewer system.},

  abstract = {USEPA recommends a multiple lines of evidence approach to make informed decisions at vapor intrusion sites because the vapor intrusion pathway is notoriously difficult to characterize. Our study uses this approach by incorporating groundwater, soil gas, indoor air field measurements and numerical models to evaluate vapor intrusion exposure risks in a Metro-Boston neighborhood known to exhibit lower than anticipated indoor air concentrations based on groundwater concentrations. We collected and evaluated five rounds of field sampling data over the period of one year. Field data results show a steep gradient in soil gas concentrations near the groundwater surface; however as the depth decreases, soil gas concentration gradients also decrease. Together, the field data and the numerical model results suggest that a subsurface feature is limiting vapor transport into indoor air spaces at the study site and that groundwater concentrations are not appropriate indicators of vapor intrusion exposure risks in this neighborhood. This research also reveals the importance of including relevant physical models when evaluating vapor intrusion exposure risks using the multiple lines of evidence approach. Overall, the findings provide insight about how the multiple lines of evidence approach can be used to inform decisions by using field data collected using regulatory-relevant sampling techniques, and a well-established 3-D vapor intrusion model.},

  abstract = {The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is finalizing its vapor intrusion guidelines. One of the important issues related to vapor intrusion is background concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in indoor air, typically attributed to consumer products and building materials. Background concentrations can exist even in the absence of vapor intrusion and are an important consideration when conducting site assessments. In addition, the development of accurate conceptual models that depict pathways for vapor entry into buildings is important during vapor intrusion site assessments. Sewer gas, either as a contributor to background concentrations or as part of the site conceptual model, is not routinely evaluated during vapor intrusion site assessments. The research described herein identifies an instance where vapors emanating directly from a sanitary sewer pipe within a residence were determined to be a source of tetrachloroethylene (PCE) detected in indoor air. Concentrations of PCE in the bathroom range from 2.1 to 190 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}g/m3 and exceed typical indoor air concentrations by orders of magnitude resulting in human health risk classified as an ``Imminent Hazard'' condition. The results suggest that infiltration of sewer gas resulted in PCE concentrations in indoor air that were nearly two orders of magnitude higher as compared to when infiltration of sewer gas was not known to be occurring. This previously understudied pathway whereby sewers serve as sources of PCE (and potentially other VOC) vapors is highlighted. Implications for vapor intrusion investigations are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Background, aim and scopeDuring the last decade, soil contamination with volatile organic contaminants (VOC) received special attention because of their potential to cause indoor air problems. Moreover, research has shown that people spend 64\% to 94\% of there time indoors; therefore, the indoor air quality is of a primary importance for exposure to VOC. Human health risks to VOC\textemdash{}in cases of soil contamination\textemdash{}are often dominated by the exposure route `inhalation of indoor air'. Exposure is often a result of vapour transport from the soil or groundwater to the indoor air of the building. Within human health risk assessments, a variety of algorithms are available that calculate transfer of soil gas to the indoor air. These algorithms suffer from a relatively high uncertainty due to a lack of representation of spatial and temporal variability. For such an application, these algorithms need to be further verified empirically against field observations so that they can be sufficiently reliable for regulatory purposes. This paper presents the accuracy for seven algorithms by using observed and predicted soil and indoor air concentrations from three sites, where the groundwater had been contaminated with aromatic and chlorinated VOC.Materials and methodsThe algorithms for vapour intrusion that are frequently used in European countries were included in this study and were Vlier\textendash{}Humaan (Flanders), CSoil (Netherlands), VolaSoil (Netherlands), Johnson \& Ettinger (USA), Risc (United Kingdom), and the dilution factor (DF) algorithms from Sweden and Norway. Three sites were investigated in more detail and samples were taken synoptically from the groundwater, soil and indoor air on four occasions. On the petroleum sites, the aromatic hydrocarbons benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes were analysed and, on the dry cleaning sites, the chlorinated hydrocarbons tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethylene and cis 1,2-dichloroethene. To increase spatial resolution, measurements in groundwater and soil air were taken in three different zones at each site, in the close proximity of or in the building. During sampling, several relevant soil properties were measured like the bulk density, water and air filled porosity, soil temperature and depth of the groundwater. Also, building properties like the dimensions of the building and the quality of the floor were registered. The seven algorithms were applied to compare that observed with the predicted concentrations in soil and indoor air. The groundwater concentrations were used as a source contamination. The results from the algorithms were compared by using performance criteria to assess the accuracy of each algorithm.ResultsAll calculations are presented in a box plot that contains the predicted soil or indoor air versus the observed concentrations. Results from the applied criteria are presented for each algorithm.DiscussionDifferences between predictions and observations were up to three orders of magnitude and can be partially related to the amount of parameters included in each algorithm and the mathematical concept used. For example, the inclusion or exclusion of a capillary fringe or temperature correction for the Henry constant: it is not clear why all algorithms tend to over-predict the soil air concentration. The prediction mostly starts with the calculation of a soil air concentration related to the Henry constant, followed by diffusive and/or convective transport to the soil surface and zone of influence around the building foundation. Further research is needed to investigate the over-predictions and the use of the Henry constant to calculate the soil air concentration should be reviewed.ConclusionsThe algorithms with the highest accuracy were the Johnson and Ettinger and the Vlier\textendash{}Humaan algorithms. The DF algorithms from Sweden and Norway resulted in higher over- and underpredictions than others. Results for the indoor air showed that all the algorithms calculate high and low concentrations in the indoor air when compared to observations. The algorithms with the highest accuracy were JEM, Vlier\textendash{}Humaan and CSoil. The DF algorithm from Norway calculated concentrations that were frequently higher than observed concentrations and the Swedish DF algorithm showed frequent higher and lower concentration than observed. The conservatism of the most accurate algorithms is sufficient for regulatory purposes, and they can trigger an integrated programme of field observations (monitoring) or/and modelling.Recommendations and perspectivesThe dataset used for this paper was derived from three sites with groundwater contamination and further verification of these algorithms should be done for other sites that have a vadose zone contamination.},

With these, we explored whether long-term VOC emission rates were related to the AER over the sector, as has been observed in the short term for some VOCs in single buildings. We fit and compared two statistical models to the data. In the independent emissions model (IEM), emissions were unaffected by other variables, while in the dependent emissions model (DEM), emissions responded to the AER via coupling through a conceptual boundary layer between the air and a lumped emission source. For 20 of 46 VOCs, the DEM was preferable to the IEM and emission rates, though variable, were higher in buildings with higher AERs. Most oxygenated VOCs and some alkanes were well fit by the DEM, while nearly all aromatics and halocarbons were independent. Trends by vapor pressure suggested multiple mechanisms could be involved. The factors of temperature, relative humidity, and building age were almost never associated with effective emission rates. Our findings suggest that effective emissions in real commercial buildings will be difficult to predict from deterministic experiments or models.},

This paper reports the results of sewer gas sampling conducted in a sanitary sewer over the years of 2014\textendash{}2017. Sewer gas samples were collected and analyzed using several different techniques, including TO-15 (grab), TO-17 (passive), Radiello\textregistered{} (passive) and a novel continuous monitoring technique, the Autonomous Rugged Optical Multigas Analyzer (AROMA). The applicability of each of the different approaches used in this study is discussed in the context of investigating sanitary sewers as a vapor intrusion alternative pathway. The data confirmed that trichloroethylene (TCE) concentrations in sewer gas were detected adjacent to and extending hundreds of feet away from a previously defined vapor intrusion area, where TCE was a primary contaminant. TCE concentrations detected in sewer gas ranged from non-detect to 1600{$\mu$}g/m3. Temporal variability was observed in TCE concentrations over timescales that ranged from minutes to months to years at discrete sampling locations. Spatial variability in sewer gas concentrations was also observed throughout the study area. Temporal and spatial variability may be caused by groundwater contamination sources in the study area, as well as sewer gas transport mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Vapor intrusion (VI) assessment is complicated by spatial and temporal variability, largely due to compounded interactions among the many individual factors that influence the vapor migration pathway from subsurface sources to indoor air. Past research on highly variable indoor air datasets demonstrates that conventional sampling schemes can result in false negative determinations of potential risk corresponding to reasonable maximum exposures (RME). While high-frequency chemical analysis of individual chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs) in indoor air is conceptually appealing, it remains largely impractical when numerous buildings are involved and particularly for long-term monitoring. As more is learned about the challenges with indoor air sampling for VI assessment, it has become clear that alternative approaches are needed to help guide discrete sampling efforts and reduce sampling requirements while maintaining acceptable confidence in exposure characterization. Indicators, tracers, and surrogates (ITS), which include a collection of quantifiable metrics and tools, have been suggested as a potential solution for making VI pathway assessment and long-term monitoring more informative, efficient, and cost-effective. This review, compilation, and evaluation of ITS demonstrates how even low numbers of indoor air CVOC samples can provide high levels of confidence for representing the RME levels (e.g., 95th percentile) often sought by regulatory agencies for less than chronic effects. A two-part compilation of available evidence for select low-cost ITS is presented, with Part 1 focused on introducing the concepts of ITS, meteorologically based ITS, and the evidence from data-rich studies to support lower cost CVOC VI assessments. Part 1 includes the results of quantitative analyses on two robust residential building VI datasets, where numerous supplemental metrics were collected concurrently with indoor air concentration data. These are supplemented with additional less-intensive studies in different circumstances. These analyses show that certain ITS metrics and tools, including differential temperature, differential pressure, and radon (in Part 2), can provide benefits to VI assessment and long-term monitoring. This includes indicators that narrow the assessment period needed to capture RME conditions, tracers that enhance understanding of the conceptual site model, and aid in the identification of preferential pathways and surrogates that support or substitute for CVOC sampling results. The results of this review provide insight into the scientifically supportable uses of ITS.},

These studies have included fate and transport modeling. Most such models have simplified the prediction of indoor air contaminant vapor concentrations by employing a steady state assumption, which often results in difficulties in reconciling these results with field measurements. This paper focuses on two major factors that may be subject to significant transients in vapor intrusion situations, including the indoor air pressure and the air exchange rate in the subject building. A three-dimensional finite element model was employed with consideration of daily and seasonal variations in these factors. From the results, the variations of indoor air pressure and air exchange rate are seen to contribute to significant variations in indoor air contaminant vapor concentrations. Depending upon the assumptions regarding the variations in these parameters, the results are only sometimes consistent with the reports of several orders of magnitude in indoor air concentration variations from field studies. The results point to the need to examine more carefully the interplay of these factors in order to quantitatively understand the variations in potential indoor air exposures.},

Contaminant soil gas data are often relatively more stable than indoor air vapor concentration measurements, but meteorological conditions might influence soil gas values. Although a few field and numerical studies have considered some temporal effects on soil gas vapor transport, a full explanation of the contaminant vapor concentration response to rainfall events is not available. This manuscript seeks to demonstrate the effects on soil vapor transport during and after different rainfall events, by applying a coupled numerical model of fluid flow and vapor transport. Both a single rainfall event and seasonal rainfall events were modeled. For the single rainfall event models, the vapor response process could be divided into three steps: namely, infiltration, water redistribution, and establishment of a water lens atop the groundwater source. In the infiltration step, rainfall intensity was found to determine the speed of the wetting front and wash-out effect on the vapor. The passage of the wetting front led to an increase of the vapor concentration in both the infiltration and water redistribution steps and this effect is noted at soil probes located 1m below the ground surface. When the mixing of groundwater with infiltrated water was not allowed, a clean water lens accumulated above the groundwater source and led to a capping effect which can reduce diffusion rates of contaminant from the source. Seasonal rainfall with short time intervals involved superposition of the individual rainfall events. This modeling results indicated that for relatively deeper soil that the infiltration wetting front could not flood, the effects were damped out in less than a month after rain; while in the long term (years), possible formation of a water lens played a larger role in determining the vapor intrusion risk. In addition, soil organic carbon retarded the transport process, and damped the contaminant concentration fluctuations.},

This study presents a three-dimensional VI model that extends the common subsurface fate and transport equations to incorporate wind and stack effects on indoor air pressure, building air exchange rate (AER) and indoor contaminant concentration to improve VI exposure risk estimates. The model incorporates three modeling programs: (1) COMSOL Multiphysics to model subsurface fate and transport processes, (2) CFD0 to model atmospheric air flow around the building, and (3) CONTAM to model indoor air quality. The combined VI model predicts AER values, zonal indoor air pressures and zonal indoor air contaminant concentrations as a function of wind speed, wind direction and outdoor and indoor temperature. Steady state modeling results for a single-story building with a basement demonstrate that wind speed, wind direction and opening locations in a building play important roles in changing the AER, indoor air pressure, and indoor air contaminant concentration. Calculated indoor air pressures ranged from approximately -10 Pa to +4 Pa depending on weather conditions and building characteristics. AER values, mass entry rates and indoor air concentrations vary depending on weather conditions and building characteristics. The presented modeling approach can be used to investigate the relationship between building features, AER, building pressures, soil gas concentrations, indoor air concentrations and VI exposure risks.},

We consider the source of the reported variability at VI sites located near Hill Air Force Base (AFB) in Utah, an EPA experimental house in Indiana, and Naval Air Station North Island in California. We focus in particular on how the indoor/outdoor pressure differences and air exchange rates affected indoor air contaminant concentrations at these sites. We investigate how these dynamics differ for a site that is characterized by a preferential pathway (like Hill AFB) and VI sites that are not influenced by such pathways, using three-dimensional fluid dynamics models and statistical analysis of the aforementioned sites. A preferential pathway can dramatically increase a VI site's sensitivity to build pressurization, provided there exist a medium allowing effective communication between a contaminant-delivering preferential pathway and the indoor air space, e.g. a permeable subslab space that may be provided by a gravel layer. Preferential pathways may also erroneously indicate the presence of indoor contaminant sources. At sites characterized by significant advective transport from the subslab to the indoor air space, much of the short-term variability in indoor air contaminant concentration can be explained by an impact of fluctuations in indoor/outdoor pressure differences. Meanwhile, air exchange rate variation drives most of the short-term variability at sites characterized by minor variations in advective transport.},

  abstract = {A correlation between partition coefficients, K, of dry building material and liquid molar volume of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in it, vl, is presented. Experiment for determining the partition coefficients of the target VOCs including benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene for two kinds of building materials was conducted by a method developed by us. The experimental data verified the correlation. Also the correlation was supported well by the experimental data in the literature. It is found that the correlation can predict the partition coefficients of VOCs with similar structure in the same building material.},

  abstract = {In this study, we investigate the soil gas concentration attenuation with diffusive transport in lateral and vertical transport in cases with surface pavements with a pilot-scale tank. Three scenarios were investigated, one with a completely open soil surface and the other two involving partially paved soil surface. The results, on the one hand, indicate that the soil gas concentration generally decreases linearly and exponentially in the vertical and horizontal transport directions, respectively, generally in accordance with available modeling studies. On the other hand, our experiment shows that low-permeability ground covers can increase shallow soil gas concentrations beneath the pavement by at most 3-4 times, inducing higher subslab concentration than that below open ground surface, even if the latter is obtained at a closer location to vapor source. For cases with uniform soil properties, our study suggests exterior soil gas sample should be taken at a depth below the building foundation by half of the building footprint size, if the vapor source is laterally extensive relative to the building footprint, or by 1\,m and 2-3\,m for slab-on-grade and basement scenarios, respectively, if the vapor source is located laterally away from the building.},

  abstract = {The partition and effective diffusion coefficients of formaldehyde were measured for three materials (conventional gypsum wallboard, ``green'' gypsum wallboard, and ``green'' carpet) under three relative humidity (RH) conditions (20\%, 50\%, and 70\% RH). The ``green'' materials contained recycled materials and were friendly to environment. A dynamic dual-chamber test method was used. Results showed that a higher relative humidity led to a larger effective diffusion coefficient for two kinds of wallboards and carpet. The carpet was also found to be very permeable resulting in an effective diffusion coefficient at the same order of magnitude with the formaldehyde diffusion coefficient in air. The partition coefficient (K ma) of formaldehyde in conventional wallboard was 1.52 times larger at 50\% RH than at 20\% RH, whereas it decreased slightly from 50\% to 70\% RH, presumably due to the combined effects of water solubility of formaldehyde and micro-pore blocking by condensed moisture at the high RH level. The partition coefficient of formaldehyde increased slightly with the increase of relative humidity in ``green'' wallboard and ``green'' carpet. At the same relative humidity level, the ``green'' wallboard had larger partition coefficient and effective diffusion coefficient than the conventional wallboard, presumably due to the micro-pore structure differences between the two materials. The data generated could be used to assess the sorption effects of formaldehyde on building materials and to evaluate its impact on the formaldehyde concentration in buildings. Implications: Based on the results of this study, the sink effects of these commonly used materials (conventional and ``green'' gypsum wallboards, ``green'' carpet) on indoor formaldehyde concentration could be estimated. The effects of relative humidity on the diffusion and partition coefficients of formaldehyde were found to differ for materials and for different humidity levels, indicating the need for further investigation of the mechanisms through which humidity effects take place.},

  abstract = {Those charged with the responsibility of estimating the risk posed by vapor intrusion (VI) processes have often looked to information contained in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s VI database for insight. Indoor air concentration attenuation factors have always been a key focus of this database, but the roles of different environmental factors in these attenuation processes are still unclear. This study aims to examine the influences of these factors in the context of the information in the VI database. The database shows that the attenuation factors vary over many orders of magnitude and that no simple statistical fluctuation around any typical mean value exists. Thus far, no simple explanation of this phenomenon has been presented. This paper examines various possible contributing factors to the enormous range of observed values, looking at which ones can plausibly contribute to explaining them.},

  abstract = {In vapor intrusion screening models, a most widely employed assumption in simulating the entry of contaminant into a building is that of a crack in the building foundation slab. Some modelers employed a perimeter crack hypothesis while others chose not to identify the crack type. However, few studies have systematically investigated the influence on vapor intrusion predictions of slab crack features, such as the shape and distribution of slab cracks and related to this overall building foundation footprint size. In this paper, predictions from a three-dimensional model of vapor intrusion are used to compare the contaminant mass flow rates into buildings with different foundation slab crack features. The simulations show that the contaminant mass flow rate into the building does not change much for different assumed slab crack shapes and locations, and the foundation footprint size does not play a significant role in determining contaminant mass flow rate through a unit area of crack. Moreover, the simulation helped reveal the distribution of subslab contaminant soil vapor concentration beneath the foundation, and the results suggest that in most cases involving no biodegradation, the variation in subslab concentration should not exceed an order of magnitude, and is often significantly less than this.},
