  abstract = {Steady-state vapor intrusion scenarios involving aerobically biodegradable chemicals are studied using a three-dimensional multicomponent numerical model. In these scenarios, sources of aerobically biodegradable chemical vapors are placed at depths of 1-14 m beneath a 10 m \texttimes{} 10 m basement or slab-on-grade construction building, and the simultaneous transport and reaction of hydrocarbon and oxygen vapors are simulated. The results are presented as Johnson and Ettinger attenuation factors {$\alpha$} (predicted indoor air hydrocarbon concentration/source vapor concentration), and normalized contour plots of hydrocarbon and oxygen concentrations. In addition to varying the vapor source depth, the effects of source concentration (2-200 mg chemical/L vapor) and oxygen-limited first-order reaction rates (0.018-1.8 h-1) are studied. Hydrocarbon inputs were specific to benzene, although the relevant properties are similar to those for a range of hydrocarbons of interest. Overall, the results suggest that aerobic biodegradation could play a significant role in reducing vapor intrusion into buildings (decreased {$\alpha$}-values) relative to the no-biodegradation case, with the significance of aerobic biodegradation increasing with increasing vapor source depth, decreasing vapor source concentration, and increasing first-order biodegradation rate. In contrast to the no-biodegradation case, differences in foundation construction can be significant in some settings. The significance of aerobic biodegradation is directly related to the extent to which oxygen is capable of migrating beneath the foundation. For example, in the case of a basement scenario with a 200 mg/L vapor source located at 3 m bgs, oxygen is consumed before it can migrate beneath the foundation, so the attenuation factors for simulations with and without aerobic biodegradation are similar for all first-order rates studied. For the case of a 2 mg/L vapor source located at 8 m bgs, the oxygen is widely distributed beneath the foundation, and the attenuation factor for the biodegradation case ranges from about 3 to 18 orders-of-magnitude less than that for the no-biodegradation case.},

However, because the surface boundary condition in the BAM is homogeneous, its applicability is limited to situations where the above ground concentration of the volatilant is zero above a boundary layer. The important situations of the accumulation of the volatilant below buildings, in vegetation or below material stored on the ground are thereby excluded from consideration. This paper derives an analytic solution for the nonhomogeneous surface boundary condition extension of the BAM which allows its exploratory potential to be extended to the more realistic scenarios mentioned above. This analytic solution contains the BAM solution as a special case.},

The time required for sorption to reach near-steady-state conditions at sites may take months or years to achieve. This study investigated the vapor phase attenuation of trichloroethylene (TCE) in five soils varying widely in clay and organic matter content using repacked columns. The primary indicators of TCE sorption were vapor retardation rate (Rt), the time required for the TCE vapor to pass through the soil column, and specific volume of retention (VR), and total volume of TCE retained in soil. Results show TCE vapor retardation is mainly due to the rapid partitioning of the compound to SOM. However, the specific volume of retention of clayey soils with secondary mineral particles was higher. Linear regression analyses of the SOM and clay fraction with VR show that a unit increase in clay fraction results in higher sorption of TCE (VR) than the SOM. However, partitioning of TCE vapor was not consistent with the samples' surface areas but was mainly a function of the type of secondary minerals present in soils.},

A three-dimensional finite element model was used to investigate the importance of factors that could influence vapor intrusion when the site is characterized by nonhomogeneous soils. Model simulations were performed to examine how soil layers of differing properties alter soil-gas concentration profiles and vapor intrusion rates into structures. The results illustrate difference in soil-gas concentration profiles and vapor intrusion rates between homogeneous and layered soils. The findings support the need for site conceptual models to adequately represent a site's geology when conducting site characterizations, interpreting field data, and assessing the risk of vapor intrusion at a given site. For instance, in layered geologies, a lower permeability and diffusivity soil layer between the source and building often limits vapor intrusion rates, even if a higher permeability layer near the foundation permits increased soil-gas flow rates into the building. In addition, the presence of water-saturated clay layers can considerably influence soil-gas concentration profiles. Therefore, interpreting field data without accounting for clay layers in the site conceptual model could result in inaccurate risk calculations. Important considerations for developing more accurate conceptual site models are discussed in light of the findings.},

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Research Park site, located in Moffett Field, CA, and comprised of 213 acres, is being planned for redevelopment as a collaborative research and educational campus with associated facilities. Groundwater contaminated with hydrocarbon and halogenated hydro-carbon volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is the primary environmental medium of concern at the site. Over a 15-month period, approximately 1000 indoor, outdoor ambient, and outdoor ambient background samples were collected from four buildings designated as historical landmarks using Summa canisters and analyzed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency TO-15 selective ion mode. Both 24-hr and sequential 8-hr samples were collected. Comparison of daily sampling results relative to daily background results indicates that the measured trichloroethylene (TCE) concentrations were primarily due to the subsurface vapor intrusion pathway, although there is likely some contribution due to infiltration of TCE from the outdoor ambient background concentrations. Analysis of the cis-1,2-dichloroethylene concentrations relative to TCE concentrations with respect to indoor air concentrations and the background air support this hypothesis; however, this indicates that relative contributions of the vapor intrusion and infiltration pathways vary with each building. Indoor TCE concentrations were also compared with indoor benzene and background benzene concentrations. These data indicate significant correlation between background benzene concentrations and the concentration of benzene in the indoor air, indicating benzene was present in the indoor air primarily through infiltration of outdoor air into the indoor space. By comparison, measured TCE indoor air concentrations showed a significantly different relationship to background concentrations. Analysis of the results show that indoor air samples can be used to definitively define the source of the TCE present in the indoor air space of large industrial buildings.},

In the absence of similar data for Ireland at the time, these were considered suitable for use due to the similarities between the climates, house types and lifestyles in the two countries. In order to better estimate the long-term radon concentration, measurements from 5640 Irish homes were used to derive a set of correction factors specifically for Ireland. These were generated by means of Fourier decomposition analysis and the new correction factors compared, using 95\% confidence intervals, to those derived for the UK using the same analysis and to those currently in use for Ireland. In both cases, a significant difference was found between 10 of the 12 monthly seasonal correction factors. This paper presents the methods used in detail and the results of the analysis.},

  abstract = {One of the goals of the French national campaign called ``Etablissements Sensibles (Sensitive Establishments)'' is to evaluate indoor air degradation in schools because of vapor intrusion of volatile compounds from soil gases towards the indoor air, related to the presence of former industrial sites on or near the establishment. During this campaign, as recommended by the United States of Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), indoor air quality was evaluated from soil gas concentrations using generic attenuation factors, and extra investigations into soil gases and indoor air were performed when the estimated values exceeded target indoor air concentrations. This study exploits matched data on subsurface soil gases and indoor air that came from the ``Sensitive Establishments'' campaign. It aims to consolidate and refine the use of attenuation factors as a function of environmental variables acquired routinely during environmental assessments. We have been able to select the measured environmental variables that have the most influence on vapor intrusion using Principal Components Analysis and hypotheses tests. Since the collected data are mainly related to weak sources (only 15\% schools required risk management measures related to vapor intrusion), halogenated volatile organic compounds (HVOC) were selected as tracer compounds for vapor intrusion for this study. This choice enables the exclusion or minimization of background sources contributions. From the results we have calculated the descriptive statistics of the attenuation factors distribution for the subslab-to-indoor air pathway and refined the attenuation factors for this pathway through an easily obtained parameter, building age. Qualitative comparison of attenuation factors according to the building age shows that attenuation factors observed for building less than 50 years are lower than attenuation factors for buildings 50 years old and above. These results show the utility of creating databases for consolidating and refining attenuation factors and therefore improving their use.},

Sorption and desorption of TCE (0.1 to 10 micrograms ml-1) and toluene (1.0 to 20 micrograms ml-1) were measured in two soils and followed a reversible linear isotherm. At a concentration of 1 micrograms ml-1, TCE was not degraded in the absence of toluene in any of the soils. In combination, both 1 microgram of TCE ml-1 and 20 micrograms of toluene ml-1 were degraded simultaneously after a lag period of approximately 60 to 80 h, and the period of degradation lasted from 70 to 90 h. Usually 60 to 75\% of the initial 1 microgram of TCE ml-1 was degraded, whereas 100\% of the toluene disappeared. A second addition of 20 micrograms of toluene ml-1 to a flask with residual TCE resulted in another 10 to 20\% removal of the chemical. Initial rates of degradation of toluene and TCE were similar at 32, 25, and 18 degrees C; however, the lag period increased with decreasing temperature. There was little difference in degradation of toluene and TCE at soil moisture contents of 16, 25, and 30\%, whereas there was no detectable degradation at 5 and 2.5\% moisture. The addition of phenol, but not benzoate, stimulated the degradation of TCE in Rindge and Yolo silt loam soils, methanol and ethylene slightly stimulated TCE degradation in Rindge soil, glucose had no effect in either soil, and dissolved organic carbon extracted from soil strongly sorbed TCE but did not affect its rate of biodegradation.},

  abstract = {The vapor intrusion impacts associated with the presence of chlorinated volatile organic contaminant plumes in the ground water beneath residential areas in Colorado and New York have been the subject of extensive site investigations and structure sampling efforts. Large data sets of ground water and indoor air monitoring data collected over a decade-long monitoring program at the Redfield, Colorado, site and monthly ground water and structure monitoring data collected over a 19-month period from structures in New York State are analyzed to illustrate the temporal and spatial distributions in the concentration of volatile organic compounds that one may encounter when evaluating the potential for exposures due to vapor intrusion. The analysis of these data demonstrates that although the areal extent of structures impacted by vapor intrusion mirrors the areal extent of chlorinated volatile organic compounds in the ground water, not all structures above the plume will be impacted. It also highlights the fact that measured concentrations of volatile organic compounds in the indoor air and subslab vapor can vary considerably from month to month and season to season. Sampling results from any one location at any given point in time cannot be expected to represent the range of conditions that may exist at neighboring locations or at other times. Recognition of this variability is important when designing sampling plans and risk management programs to address the vapor intrusion pathway.},

An updated database of national radon exposures for 66 countries allows the global burden of lung cancer mortality attributable to radon to be estimated.Objective:Our goal was to estimate the global population attributable burden of lung cancer mortality in 2012 from residential radon.Methods:Estimates of the population attributable risk (PAR) of lung cancer mortality from radon were determined using the attributable fraction approach, using three models for excess relative risk of lung cancer from radon.Results:The estimates of the median PAR of lung cancer mortality from residential radon in 2012 for the 66 countries having representative national radon surveys were consistent, as 16.5\%, 14.4\%, and 13.6\% for the exposure\textendash{}age\textendash{}concentration (EAC) model (BEIR VI), the Hunter model, and the Kreuzer model, respectively. The mean PAR using the EAC model ranged from 4.2\% (95\% CI: 0.9, 11.7) for Japan, to 29.3\% (95\% CI: 22.9, 35.7) for Armenia, with a median for the 66 countries of 16.5\%. Radon-attributable lung cancer deaths for all 66 countries totaled 226,057 in 2012 and represent a median of 3.0\% of total cancer deaths.Conclusions:Consistent findings between the three models used to estimate excess relative risks of lung cancer from radon, and between the attributable fraction methodology and the life table analysis, confirm that residential radon is responsible for a substantial proportion of lung cancer mortality worldwide.  https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2503},

In many cases, individual container/enclosure sampling and subsequent field emission rate measurements from isolated consumer products were used to determine if identified products were likely to be the primary source of vapors in the residence. The portable GC/MS was also used to characterize vapor intrusion in two residences. In one of these two residences, building pressure control was used to enhance vapor entry in order to facilitate the investigation resulting in confirmation of vapor intrusion and identification of a primary route of vapor entry. cVOCs were identified in 42 of the 46 homes investigated, subsurface vapor intrusion was identified in two homes, and two homes had inconclusive results.},

  abstract = {Vapor intrusion (VI) pathway assessment and data interpretation have been guided by an historical conceptual model in which vapors originating from contaminated soil or groundwater diffuse upward through soil and are swept into a building by soil gas flow induced by building underpressurization. Recent studies reveal that alternative VI pathways involving neighborhood sewers, land drains, and other major underground piping can also be significant VI contributors, even to buildings beyond the delineated footprint of soil and groundwater contamination. This work illustrates how controlled-pressure-method testing (CPM), soil gas sampling, and screening-level emissions calculations can be used to identify significant alternative VI pathways that might go undetected by conventional sampling under natural conditions at some sites. The combined utility of these tools is shown through data collected at a long-term study house, where a significant alternative VI pathway was discovered and altered so that it could be manipulated to be on or off. Data collected during periods of natural and CPM conditions show that the alternative pathway was significant, but its presence was not identifiable under natural conditions; it was identified under CPM conditions when measured emission rates were 2 orders of magnitude greater than screening-model estimates and subfoundation vertical soil gas profiles changed and were no longer consistent with the conventional VI conceptual model.},

  abstract = {Soil vapour transport to indoor air is an important potential exposure pathway at many sites impacted by subsurface volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The inclusion of biodegradation in vadose zone transport models for benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX) and fuel hydrocarbons has been proposed; however, there is still significant uncertainty regarding biodegradation rates and the local effects of buildings or ground surface cover on fate and transport processes. The objective of this study was to evaluate biodegradation processes through comprehensive monitoring at a site contaminated with BTX and model simulation. Study methods included extensive vertical profiling of BTX vapour and light gas (oxygen and carbon dioxide) concentrations and moisture content, and semi-continuous monitoring of oxygen and pressure below a building floor slab. Significant vadose zone biodegradation over a relatively small depth interval was observed. Based on the observed soil vapour profile, first-order biodegradation rates were estimated by fitting an analytical solution for diffusion and biodecay to the data. Degradation rates were found to compare well to other reported laboratory and field data. A two-dimensional (2-D) numerical model incorporating vapour-phase diffusion, advection, sorption and biodegradation was used to simulate the effect of a building floor slab on transport processes. Model results demonstrate the sensitivity of vapour-phase BTX and oxygen transport to partial barriers to diffusion (e.g. building foundation) and highlight the importance of using a model that ties biodecay to oxygen availability. In addition, depressurization within a building and advective transport is shown to have a potentially significant effect on BTX fate, in soil below.},

  abstract = {A detailed seasonal study of soil vapor intrusion at a cold climate site with average yearly temperature of 1.9 \textdegree{}C was conducted at a house with a crawlspace that overlay a shallow dissolved-phase petroleum hydrocarbon (gasoline) plume in North Battleford, Saskatchewan, Canada. This research was conducted primarily to assess if winter conditions, including snow/frost cover, and cold soil temperatures, influence aerobic biodegradation of petroleum vapors in soil and the potential for vapor intrusion. Continuous time-series data for oxygen, pressure differentials, soil temperature, soil moisture, and weather conditions were collected from a high-resolution monitoring network. Seasonal monitoring of groundwater, soil vapor, crawlspace air, and indoor air was also undertaken. Petroleum hydrocarbon vapor attenuation and biodegradation rates were not significantly reduced during low temperature winter months and there was no evidence for a significant capping effect of snow or frost cover that would limit oxygen ingress from the atmosphere. In the residual light nonaqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) source area adjacent to the house, evidence for biodegradation included rapid attenuation of hydrocarbon vapor concentrations over a vertical interval of approximately 0.9 m, and a corresponding decrease in oxygen to less than 1.5\% v/v. In comparison, hydrocarbon vapor concentrations above the dissolved plume and below the house were much lower and decreased sharply within a few tens of centimeters above the groundwater source. Corresponding oxygen concentrations in soil gas were at least 10\% v/v. A reactive transport model (MIN3P-DUSTY) was initially calibrated to data from vertical profiles at the site to obtain biodegradation rates, and then used to simulate the observed soil vapor distribution. The calibrated model indicated that soil vapor transport was dominated by diffusion and aerobic biodegradation, and that crawlspace pressures and soil gas advection had little influence on soil vapor concentrations.},

When they are discovered during pre-sampling inspection, indoor sources are removed and air sampling is delayed, with the assumption that a few hours to a few days are sufficient for indoor source impacts to dissipate. This assumption was tested through the controlled release of SF6 and its monitoring in indoor air and soil gas at a study house over 2 years. Results show that indoor sources generate subsurface soil gas clouds as a result of fluctuating direction in the exchange between soil gas and indoor air and that it may take days to weeks under natural conditions for a soil gas cloud beneath a building to dissipate following indoor source removal. The data also reveal temporal variability in indoor air and soil gas concentrations, long-term seasonal patterns, and dissipation of soil gas clouds over days to weeks following source removal. Preliminary modeling results for similar conditions are consistent field observations. If representative of other sites, these results suggest that a typical 1-3 day waiting period following indoor source removal may not be sufficient to avoid confounding data and erroneous conclusions regarding VI occurrence.},

This study collected a long-term and high-frequency data set that can be used to assess indoor air sampling strategies for answering key pathway assessment questions like: ``Is VI occurring?'', and ``Will VI impacts exceed thresholds of concern?''. Indoor air sampling was conducted for 2.5 years at 2\textendash{}4 h intervals in a house overlying a dilute chlorinated solvent plume (10\textendash{}50 {$\mu$}g/L TCE). Indoor air concentrations varied by 3 orders of magnitude ({$<$}0.01\textendash{}10 ppbv TCE) with two recurring behaviors. The VI-active behavior, which was prevalent in fall, winter, and spring involved time-varying impacts intermixed with sporadic periods of inactivity; the VI-dormant behavior, which was prevalent in the summer, involved long periods of inactivity with sporadic VI impacts. These data were used to study outcomes of three simple sparse data sampling plans; the probabilities of false-negative and false-positive decisions were dependent on the ratio of the (action level/true mean of the data), the number of exceedances needed, and the sampling strategy. The analysis also suggested a significant potential for poor characterization of long-term mean concentrations with sparse sampling plans. The results point to a need for additional dense data sets and further investigation into the robustness of possible VI assessment paradigms.

  abstract = {Vapor intrusion characterization efforts can be challenging due to complexities associated with background indoor air constituents, preferential subsurface migration pathways, and response time and representativeness limitations associated with conventional low-frequency monitoring methods. For sites experiencing trichloroethylene (TCE) vapor intrusion, the potential for acute risks poses additional challenges, as the need for rapid response to exposure exceedances becomes critical in order to minimize health risks and associated liabilities. Continuous monitoring platforms have been deployed to monitor indoor and subsurface concentrations of key volatile constituents, atmospheric pressure, and pressure differential conditions that can result in advective transport. These systems can be comprised of multiplexed laboratory-grade analytical components integrated with telemetry and geographical information systems for automatically generating time-stamped renderings of observations and time-weighted averages through a cloud-based data management platform. Integrated automatic alerting and responses can also be engaged within one minute of risk exceedance detection. The objectives at a site selected for testing included continuous monitoring of vapor concentrations and related surface and subsurface physical parameters to understand exposure risks over space and time and to evaluate potential mechanisms controlling risk dynamics which could then be used to design a long-term risk reduction strategy. High-frequency data collection, processing, and automated visualization efforts have resulted in greater understanding of natural processes such as dynamic contaminant vapor intrusion risk conditions potentially influenced by localized barometric pumping induced by temperature changes. For the selected site, temporal correlation was observed between dynamic indoor TCE vapor concentration, barometric pressure, and pressure differential. This correlation was observed with a predictable daily frequency even for very slight diurnal changes in barometric pressure and associated pressure differentials measured between subslab and indoor regimes and suggests that advective vapor transport and intrusion can result in elevated indoor TCE concentrations well above risk levels even with low-to-modest pressure differentials. This indicates that vapor intrusion can occur in response to diurnal pressure dynamics in coastal regions and suggests that similar natural phenomenon may control vapor intrusion dynamics in other regions, exhibiting similar pressure, geochemical, hydrogeologic, and climatic conditions. While dynamic indoor TCE concentrations have been observed in this coastal environment, questions remain regarding whether this hydrogeologic and climatic setting represent a special case, and how best to determine when continuous monitoring should be required to most appropriately minimize exposure durations as early as possible. \textcopyright{}2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Since the spring of 1993, the soil gas radon concentration was measured as a time series, at a depth of 1 m in three locations under and near a research house near Stockholm, along with indoor radon and environmental parameters. This report discusses the degree to which the house versus the weather interacts with and influences the soil gas radon concentration, and how much the influence of these two factors on the soil gas radon content varies with season and location. Strong correlations with barometric pressure and outdoor temperature occurred. The maximum soil gas concentrations occurred during the summer months and the minimum occurred during the winter, with the summer and winter levels differing by a factor of 2 to 3, depending on location. Changes in the 24-h averaged indoor radon concentration correlated well with the changes in the soil radon. The degree to which soil gas radon content may be used as an indicator of indoor radon contamination is discussed.},

An aerobic, methane-oxidizing bacterium was isolated that degrades TCE in pure culture at concentrations commonly observed in contaminated groundwater. Strain 46-1, a type I methanotrophic bacterium, degraded TCE if grown on methane or methanol, producing CO2 and water-soluble products. Gas chromatography and 14C radiotracer techniques were used to determine the rate, methane dependence, and mechanism of TCE biodegradation. TCE biodegradation by strain 46-1 appears to be a cometabolic process that occurs when the organism is actively metabolizing a suitable growth substrate such as methane or methanol. It is proposed that TCE biodegradation by methanotrophs occurs by formation of TCE epoxide, which breaks down spontaneously in water to form dichloroacetic and glyoxylic acids and one-carbon products.},

The potential for different assessment paradigms for aerobically biodegradable and recalcitrant chemicals is also frequently debated. In this work, the soil-gas distribution beneath and around a slab-on-grade building overlying shallow (0.5 to {$>$}1.5 m below ground surface) petroleum hydrocarbon\textendash{}impacted coarse alluvial soils was studied. The study spanned about 12 months, including the sampling of soil-gas hydrocarbon and oxygen concentrations, subslab soil vs. building pressure differentials and included weather conditions. Three-dimensional soil-gas concentration ``snapshots'' using samples from 79 soil-gas sampling points are presented here. Significant spatial variability was observed with hydrocarbon and oxygen concentrations ranging from about {$<$}0.01 to 200 mg/L and 0 to 21\% v/v, respectively. The presence of oxygen and the depth to petroleum-impacted soils appeared to be the dominant factors in controlling the soil-gas distribution; the depletion of hydrocarbons over short lateral and vertical distances ({$<$}2 m) was observed in the well-oxygenated regions. Composition data suggest preferential biodegradation of lighter compounds at some points, as reflected in the ratio of the masses of chemicals eluting on the gas chromatography between methane and pentane (C1 and C5) and all others after pentane ({$>$}C5).},

Results showed that the system provided rapid pressure field extension and radon control as much as 100 days of operation before optimum volatile organic compound (VOC) mitigation was achieved. Greater variability in VOC concentrations than in radon concentrations was observed during the initial mitigation system cycling. Subslab VOC concentrations at numerous locations increased during this initial period of SSD operation, and indoor air VOC concentrations were more variable than radon. However, indoor air concentrations were considerably less variable (and lower) during the first year of continuous mitigation system operation. \textcopyright{}2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Pressure control was achieved in five of six buildings where the investigation program was tested. For these five buildings, the induced pressure differences were sufficient to control the flow of soil gas through the building foundation. A comparison of VOC concentrations in indoor air measured during the negative and positive pressure test conditions was sufficient to determine whether vapor intrusion was the primary source of VOCs in indoor air at these buildings.

Although the importance of sewer lines for volatile organic compound (VOC) transport has been documented at a small number of sites with vapor intrusion, sewer lines are not routinely sampled during most vapor intrusion investigations. We have used a tracer study and VOC concentration measurements to evaluate the role of the combined sanitary/storm sewer line in VOC transport at the USEPA vapor intrusion research duplex in Indianapolis, Indiana. The results from the tracer study demonstrated gas migration from the sewer main line into the duplex. The migration pathway appears to be complex and may include leakage from the sewer lateral at a location below the building foundation. Vapor samples collected from the sewer line demonstrated the presence of tetrachloroethene (PCE) and chloroform in the sewer main in front of the duplex and at multiple sample locations within the sewer line upstream of the duplex. These test results combined with results from the prior multi-year study of the duplex indicate that the sewer line plays an important role in transport of VOCs from the subsurface source to the immediate vicinity of the duplex building envelope.},

Indoor materials can act as buffers for VOCs, reducing peak concentrations but prolonging the presence of compounds in the air. The purpose of this paper is to present quantitative experimental results on diffusion and sorption of VOCs in indoor materials and to discuss the impact of these processes on indoor air quality. A two-flow system was chosen for the present study because this method allows mass flow across materials to be directly observed. For some materials, effective diffusion coefficients were only 1 order of magnitude below what is found in air. Two types of concrete showed a very high sorption capacity for ethyl acetate. Steady-state calculations were performed within a model room. By considering various wall materials, the influences of diffusion and of sorption on the air quality of the room are discussed. Regarding the case of gypsum board walls, it may be concluded that diffusion through the material can contribute to reducing the room air concentration, especially at low ventilation rates. The results indicate that sorption and diffusion processes can affect the ventilation requirements in such rooms.},

The approach results in four simple rules for constructing mass transfer coefficients. Results are analogous to electrical circuit theory with resistors, including variable resistors or potentiometers, in parallel and series. This general approach lends itself particularly well to vapor intrusion calculations where there are multi-media compartments involving groundwater, soil, and air. In addition to showing that the model reduces to the well-known Johnson \& Ettinger model in limiting cases, we illustrate its simplicity and ease of use with several examples: (1) an example of how multiple partition coefficients collapse into a single partition coefficient illustrated by a three-phase problem involving tar, water, and air, (2) determination of when the presence of a basement significantly lowers first floor exposures, and (3) addition of diffusion in the saturated zone to the model to investigate whether the resistance associated with this compartment can be neglected. We conclude that if the water table is truly steady, this resistance would be very significant. Therefore, a vapor intrusion model that neglects both water table fluctuations and diffusion in groundwater is ignoring important physical phenomena.},

  abstract = {We describe the results of a five-month study during which 222Rn (radon) concentration, air- exchange (or ventilation) rate, and weather and radon source parameters were continuously monitored in a house near Chicago, with a view to accounting for the radon entry rate. The results suggest that the basement sump and perimeter drain-tile system played an important role in influencing the radon entry rate and that pressure-driven flow was more important than diffusion as a mechanism for radon entry. For the first 15 weeks of the study period the mean indoor radon concentration and air-exchange rate were 2.6pCi{$\mathscr{l}-$}1 (96 Bq m-3) and 0.22h-1, respectively; both parameters varied over a wide range. Radon concentration measured at the sump cover varied bimodally between 0 and 10 pCi{$\mathscr{l}-$}1 (0\textendash{}400 Bqm-3) and 300\textendash{}700 pCi{$\mathscr{l}-$}1 (10,000\textendash{}30,000 Bq m-3). These two modes corresponded well to periods of low and high indoor radon concentration; average indoor concentrations for these periods were 1.5 and 6.5 pCi{$\mathscr{l}-$}1 (55 and 240 Bq m-3), respectively. For data sorted into two groups according to radon activity at the sump, the indoor radon concentration showed little dependence on air-exchange rate. This result is accounted for by a model in which the radon entry rate, determined by mass balance, has two components\textemdash{}one diffusive, the other a pressure-driven flow component which is presumed to be proportional to the air-exchange rate. In fitting this model to the data we found that (1) the flow component dominated the diffusive component for periods of both high and low activity at the sump and (2) the magnitude of the diffusive component agreed well with the expected contributions of radon emanating from concrete and soil and diffusing into the house. To account for the flow component, we hypothesize that pressure drives air carrying a high concentration of radon generated in the soil, either through the bulk of the soil or along the outside of the basement walls, then into the basement through cracks and openings. During the final six weeks of the study, measurements were made with the water level in the sump maintained first below, then above the entrance of the pipe connected to the perimeter drain tile system. Average indoor radon concentrations during these two periods were 10.6 and 3.5 pCi{$\mathscr{l}-$}1 (390 and 130 Bq m-3), respectively. The relatively high latter value compared with the mean for the first 15 weeks, combined with the observation of intervals of high airborne alpha activity at the sump during this period, suggest that the level of water in the sump does not, by itself, account for the variation in alpha activity at the sump that we had previously observed. Fireplace operation substantially increased the air-exchange rate, but had only a small effect on indoor radon concentration, providing corroborative evidence that pressure-driven flow is an important mechanism for radon entry into this house.},

  abstract = {Investigations at former dry cleaning sites in Denmark show that sewer systems often are a major vapor intrusion pathway for chlorinated solvents to indoor air. In more than 20 percent of the contaminated drycleaner sites in Central Denmark Region, sewer systems were determined to be a major vapor intrusion pathway. Sewer systems can be a major intrusion pathway if contaminated groundwater intrudes into the sewer and contamination is transported within the sewer pipe by water flow in either free phase or dissolved states. Additionally, the contamination can volatilize from the water phase or soil gas can intrude the sewer system directly. In the sewer, the gas phase can migrate in any direction by convective transport or diffusion. Indications of the sewer as a major intrusion pathway are: higher concentrations in the upper floors in buildings, higher concentrations in indoor air than expected from soil gas measurements, higher concentrations in bathrooms/kitchen than in living rooms, chlorinated solvents in the sewer system, and a pressure gradient from the sewer system to indoor air. Measurements to detect whether or not the sewer system is an intrusion pathway are simple. In Central Denmark Region, the concentrations of contaminants are routinely measured in the indoor air at all floors, the outdoor air, behind the water traps in the building, and in the manholes close to the building. The indoor and outdoor air concentration, as well as concentrations in manholes, are measured by passive sampling on sorbent samplers over a 14-day period, and the measurements inside the sewer system are carried out by active sampling using carbon tubes (sorbent samplers). Furthermore, the pressure gradient over the building slab and between the indoor air and the sewer system are also measured. A simple test is depressurization of the sewer system. Using this technique, the pressure gradient between the sewer system and the indoor air is altered toward the sewer system\textemdash{}the contamination cannot enter the indoor air through the sewer system. If the sewer system is a major intrusion pathway, the effect of the test can be observed immediately in the indoor air. Remediation of a sewer transported contamination can be: prevention of the contaminants from intruding into the sewer system or prevention of the contaminated gas in the sewer system from intruding into the indoor air. Remediation techniques include the following: lining of the sewer piping to prevent the contamination from intruding into the sewer; sealing the sewer system in the building to prevent the contamination from the sewer system to intrude the indoor air; venting of manholes; and depressurizing the sewer system.},

Our study uses this approach by incorporating groundwater, soil gas, indoor air field measurements and numerical models to evaluate vapor intrusion exposure risks in a Metro-Boston neighborhood known to exhibit lower than anticipated indoor air concentrations based on groundwater concentrations. We collected and evaluated five rounds of field sampling data over the period of one year. Field data results show a steep gradient in soil gas concentrations near the groundwater surface; however as the depth decreases, soil gas concentration gradients also decrease. Together, the field data and the numerical model results suggest that a subsurface feature is limiting vapor transport into indoor air spaces at the study site and that groundwater concentrations are not appropriate indicators of vapor intrusion exposure risks in this neighborhood. This research also reveals the importance of including relevant physical models when evaluating vapor intrusion exposure risks using the multiple lines of evidence approach. Overall, the findings provide insight about how the multiple lines of evidence approach can be used to inform decisions by using field data collected using regulatory-relevant sampling techniques, and a well-established 3-D vapor intrusion model.},

  abstract = {The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is finalizing its vapor intrusion guidelines. One of the important issues related to vapor intrusion is background concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in indoor air, typically attributed to consumer products and building materials. Background concentrations can exist even in the absence of vapor intrusion and are an important consideration when conducting site assessments. In addition, the development of accurate conceptual models that depict pathways for vapor entry into buildings is important during vapor intrusion site assessments. Sewer gas, either as a contributor to background concentrations or as part of the site conceptual model, is not routinely evaluated during vapor intrusion site assessments. The research described herein identifies an instance where vapors emanating directly from a sanitary sewer pipe within a residence were determined to be a source of tetrachloroethylene (PCE) detected in indoor air. Concentrations of PCE in the bathroom range from 2.1 to 190 \textmu{}g/m3 and exceed typical indoor air concentrations by orders of magnitude resulting in human health risk classified as an ``Imminent Hazard'' condition. The results suggest that infiltration of sewer gas resulted in PCE concentrations in indoor air that were nearly two orders of magnitude higher as compared to when infiltration of sewer gas was not known to be occurring. This previously understudied pathway whereby sewers serve as sources of PCE (and potentially other VOC) vapors is highlighted. Implications for vapor intrusion investigations are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Background, aim and scopeDuring the last decade, soil contamination with volatile organic contaminants (VOC) received special attention because of their potential to cause indoor air problems. Moreover, research has shown that people spend 64\% to 94\% of there time indoors; therefore, the indoor air quality is of a primary importance for exposure to VOC. Human health risks to VOC\textemdash{}in cases of soil contamination\textemdash{}are often dominated by the exposure route `inhalation of indoor air'. Exposure is often a result of vapour transport from the soil or groundwater to the indoor air of the building. Within human health risk assessments, a variety of algorithms are available that calculate transfer of soil gas to the indoor air. These algorithms suffer from a relatively high uncertainty due to a lack of representation of spatial and temporal variability. For such an application, these algorithms need to be further verified empirically against field observations so that they can be sufficiently reliable for regulatory purposes. This paper presents the accuracy for seven algorithms by using observed and predicted soil and indoor air concentrations from three sites, where the groundwater had been contaminated with aromatic and chlorinated VOC.Materials and methodsThe algorithms for vapour intrusion that are frequently used in European countries were included in this study and were Vlier\textendash{}Humaan (Flanders), CSoil (Netherlands), VolaSoil (Netherlands), Johnson \& Ettinger (USA), Risc (United Kingdom), and the dilution factor (DF) algorithms from Sweden and Norway. Three sites were investigated in more detail and samples were taken synoptically from the groundwater, soil and indoor air on four occasions. On the petroleum sites, the aromatic hydrocarbons benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes were analysed and, on the dry cleaning sites, the chlorinated hydrocarbons tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethylene and cis 1,2-dichloroethene. To increase spatial resolution, measurements in groundwater and soil air were taken in three different zones at each site, in the close proximity of or in the building. During sampling, several relevant soil properties were measured like the bulk density, water and air filled porosity, soil temperature and depth of the groundwater. Also, building properties like the dimensions of the building and the quality of the floor were registered. The seven algorithms were applied to compare that observed with the predicted concentrations in soil and indoor air. The groundwater concentrations were used as a source contamination. The results from the algorithms were compared by using performance criteria to assess the accuracy of each algorithm.ResultsAll calculations are presented in a box plot that contains the predicted soil or indoor air versus the observed concentrations. Results from the applied criteria are presented for each algorithm.DiscussionDifferences between predictions and observations were up to three orders of magnitude and can be partially related to the amount of parameters included in each algorithm and the mathematical concept used. For example, the inclusion or exclusion of a capillary fringe or temperature correction for the Henry constant: it is not clear why all algorithms tend to over-predict the soil air concentration. The prediction mostly starts with the calculation of a soil air concentration related to the Henry constant, followed by diffusive and/or convective transport to the soil surface and zone of influence around the building foundation. Further research is needed to investigate the over-predictions and the use of the Henry constant to calculate the soil air concentration should be reviewed.ConclusionsThe algorithms with the highest accuracy were the Johnson and Ettinger and the Vlier\textendash{}Humaan algorithms. The DF algorithms from Sweden and Norway resulted in higher over- and underpredictions than others. Results for the indoor air showed that all the algorithms calculate high and low concentrations in the indoor air when compared to observations. The algorithms with the highest accuracy were JEM, Vlier\textendash{}Humaan and CSoil. The DF algorithm from Norway calculated concentrations that were frequently higher than observed concentrations and the Swedish DF algorithm showed frequent higher and lower concentration than observed. The conservatism of the most accurate algorithms is sufficient for regulatory purposes, and they can trigger an integrated programme of field observations (monitoring) or/and modelling.Recommendations and perspectivesThe dataset used for this paper was derived from three sites with groundwater contamination and further verification of these algorithms should be done for other sites that have a vadose zone contamination.},

With these, we explored whether long-term VOC emission rates were related to the AER over the sector, as has been observed in the short term for some VOCs in single buildings. We fit and compared two statistical models to the data. In the independent emissions model (IEM), emissions were unaffected by other variables, while in the dependent emissions model (DEM), emissions responded to the AER via coupling through a conceptual boundary layer between the air and a lumped emission source. For 20 of 46 VOCs, the DEM was preferable to the IEM and emission rates, though variable, were higher in buildings with higher AERs. Most oxygenated VOCs and some alkanes were well fit by the DEM, while nearly all aromatics and halocarbons were independent. Trends by vapor pressure suggested multiple mechanisms could be involved. The factors of temperature, relative humidity, and building age were almost never associated with effective emission rates. Our findings suggest that effective emissions in real commercial buildings will be difficult to predict from deterministic experiments or models.},

This paper reports the results of sewer gas sampling conducted in a sanitary sewer over the years of 2014\textendash{}2017. Sewer gas samples were collected and analyzed using several different techniques, including TO-15 (grab), TO-17 (passive), Radiello\textregistered{} (passive) and a novel continuous monitoring technique, the Autonomous Rugged Optical Multigas Analyzer (AROMA). The applicability of each of the different approaches used in this study is discussed in the context of investigating sanitary sewers as a vapor intrusion alternative pathway. The data confirmed that trichloroethylene (TCE) concentrations in sewer gas were detected adjacent to and extending hundreds of feet away from a previously defined vapor intrusion area, where TCE was a primary contaminant. TCE concentrations detected in sewer gas ranged from non-detect to 1600{$\mu$}g/m3. Temporal variability was observed in TCE concentrations over timescales that ranged from minutes to months to years at discrete sampling locations. Spatial variability in sewer gas concentrations was also observed throughout the study area. Temporal and spatial variability may be caused by groundwater contamination sources in the study area, as well as sewer gas transport mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Vapor intrusion (VI) assessment is complicated by spatial and temporal variability, largely due to compounded interactions among the many individual factors that influence the vapor migration pathway from subsurface sources to indoor air. Past research on highly variable indoor air datasets demonstrates that conventional sampling schemes can result in false negative determinations of potential risk corresponding to reasonable maximum exposures (RME). While high-frequency chemical analysis of individual chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs) in indoor air is conceptually appealing, it remains largely impractical when numerous buildings are involved and particularly for long-term monitoring. As more is learned about the challenges with indoor air sampling for VI assessment, it has become clear that alternative approaches are needed to help guide discrete sampling efforts and reduce sampling requirements while maintaining acceptable confidence in exposure characterization. Indicators, tracers, and surrogates (ITS), which include a collection of quantifiable metrics and tools, have been suggested as a potential solution for making VI pathway assessment and long-term monitoring more informative, efficient, and cost-effective. This review, compilation, and evaluation of ITS demonstrates how even low numbers of indoor air CVOC samples can provide high levels of confidence for representing the RME levels (e.g., 95th percentile) often sought by regulatory agencies for less than chronic effects. A two-part compilation of available evidence for select low-cost ITS is presented, with Part 1 focused on introducing the concepts of ITS, meteorologically based ITS, and the evidence from data-rich studies to support lower cost CVOC VI assessments. Part 1 includes the results of quantitative analyses on two robust residential building VI datasets, where numerous supplemental metrics were collected concurrently with indoor air concentration data. These are supplemented with additional less-intensive studies in different circumstances. These analyses show that certain ITS metrics and tools, including differential temperature, differential pressure, and radon (in Part 2), can provide benefits to VI assessment and long-term monitoring. This includes indicators that narrow the assessment period needed to capture RME conditions, tracers that enhance understanding of the conceptual site model, and aid in the identification of preferential pathways and surrogates that support or substitute for CVOC sampling results. The results of this review provide insight into the scientifically supportable uses of ITS.},

  abstract = {There has, in recent years, been increasing interest in understanding the transport processes of relevance in vapor intrusion of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into buildings on contaminated sites. These studies have included fate and transport modeling. Most such models have simplified the prediction of indoor air contaminant vapor concentrations by employing a steady state assumption, which often results in difficulties in reconciling these results with field measurements. This paper focuses on two major factors that may be subject to significant transients in vapor intrusion situations, including the indoor air pressure and the air exchange rate in the subject building. A three-dimensional finite element model was employed with consideration of daily and seasonal variations in these factors. From the results, the variations of indoor air pressure and air exchange rate are seen to contribute to significant variations in indoor air contaminant vapor concentrations. Depending upon the assumptions regarding the variations in these parameters, the results are only sometimes consistent with the reports of several orders of magnitude in indoor air concentration variations from field studies. The results point to the need to examine more carefully the interplay of these factors in order to quantitatively understand the variations in potential indoor air exposures.},

  abstract = {The U.S. government and various agencies have published guidelines for field investigation of vapor intrusion, most of which suggest soil gas sampling as an integral part of the investigation. Contaminant soil gas data are often relatively more stable than indoor air vapor concentration measurements, but meteorological conditions might influence soil gas values. Although a few field and numerical studies have considered some temporal effects on soil gas vapor transport, a full explanation of the contaminant vapor concentration response to rainfall events is not available. This manuscript seeks to demonstrate the effects on soil vapor transport during and after different rainfall events, by applying a coupled numerical model of fluid flow and vapor transport. Both a single rainfall event and seasonal rainfall events were modeled. For the single rainfall event models, the vapor response process could be divided into three steps: namely, infiltration, water redistribution, and establishment of a water lens atop the groundwater source. In the infiltration step, rainfall intensity was found to determine the speed of the wetting front and wash-out effect on the vapor. The passage of the wetting front led to an increase of the vapor concentration in both the infiltration and water redistribution steps and this effect is noted at soil probes located 1m below the ground surface. When the mixing of groundwater with infiltrated water was not allowed, a clean water lens accumulated above the groundwater source and led to a capping effect which can reduce diffusion rates of contaminant from the source. Seasonal rainfall with short time intervals involved superposition of the individual rainfall events. This modeling results indicated that for relatively deeper soil that the infiltration wetting front could not flood, the effects were damped out in less than a month after rain; while in the long term (years), possible formation of a water lens played a larger role in determining the vapor intrusion risk. In addition, soil organic carbon retarded the transport process, and damped the contaminant concentration fluctuations.},

  abstract = {Vapor intrusion (IV) exposure risks are difficult to characterize due to the role of atmospheric, building and subsurface processes. This study presents a three-dimensional VI model that extends the common subsurface fate and transport equations to incorporate wind and stack effects on indoor air pressure, building air exchange rate (AER) and indoor contaminant concentration to improve VI exposure risk estimates. The model incorporates three modeling programs: (1) COMSOL Multiphysics to model subsurface fate and transport processes, (2) CFD0 to model atmospheric air flow around the building, and (3) CONTAM to model indoor air quality. The combined VI model predicts AER values, zonal indoor air pressures and zonal indoor air contaminant concentrations as a function of wind speed, wind direction and outdoor and indoor temperature. Steady state modeling results for a single-story building with a basement demonstrate that wind speed, wind direction and opening locations in a building play important roles in changing the AER, indoor air pressure, and indoor air contaminant concentration. Calculated indoor air pressures ranged from approximately -10 Pa to +4 Pa depending on weather conditions and building characteristics. AER values, mass entry rates and indoor air concentrations vary depending on weather conditions and building characteristics. The presented modeling approach can be used to investigate the relationship between building features, AER, building pressures, soil gas concentrations, indoor air concentrations and VI exposure risks.},

  abstract = {Temporal variability in indoor air contaminant concentrations at vapor intrusion (VI) sites has been a concern for some time. We consider the source of the reported variability at VI sites located near Hill Air Force Base (AFB) in Utah, an EPA experimental house in Indiana, and Naval Air Station North Island in California. We focus in particular on how the indoor/outdoor pressure differences and air exchange rates affected indoor air contaminant concentrations at these sites. We investigate how these dynamics differ for a site that is characterized by a preferential pathway (like Hill AFB) and VI sites that are not influenced by such pathways, using three-dimensional fluid dynamics models and statistical analysis of the aforementioned sites. A preferential pathway can dramatically increase a VI site's sensitivity to build pressurization, provided there exist a medium allowing effective communication between a contaminant-delivering preferential pathway and the indoor air space, e.g. a permeable subslab space that may be provided by a gravel layer. Preferential pathways may also erroneously indicate the presence of indoor contaminant sources. At sites characterized by significant advective transport from the subslab to the indoor air space, much of the short-term variability in indoor air contaminant concentration can be explained by an impact of fluctuations in indoor/outdoor pressure differences. Meanwhile, air exchange rate variation drives most of the short-term variability at sites characterized by minor variations in advective transport.},

  abstract = {The hypothesis that in utero exposures to low levels of trichloroethylene (TCE) may increase the risk of congenital heart defects (CHDs) in offspring remains a subject of substantial controversy within the scientific community due primarily to the reliance on an inconsistent and unreproducible experimental study in rats. To build on previous assessments that have primarily focused on epidemiological and experimental animal studies in developing conclusions, the objective of the current study is to conduct a systematic evaluation of mechanistic data related to in utero exposures to TCE and the development of CHDs. The evidence base was heterogeneous; 79 mechanistic datasets were identified, characterizing endpoints which ranged from molecular to organismal responses in seven species, involving both in vivo and in vitro study designs in mammalian and non-mammalian models. Of these, 24 datasets were considered reliable following critical appraisal using a study quality tool that employs metrics specific to the study type. Subsequent synthesis and integration demonstrated that the available mechanistic data: 1) did not support the potential for CHD hazard in humans, 2) did not support the biological plausibility of a response in humans based on organization via a putative adverse outcome pathway for valvulo-septal cardiac defects, and 3) were not suitable for serving as candidate studies in risk assessment. Findings supportive of an association were generally limited to in ovo chicken studies, in which TCE was administered in high concentration solutions via direct injection. Results of these in ovo studies were difficult to interpret for human health risk assessment given the lack of generalizability of the study models (including dose relevance, species-specific biological differences, variations in the construct of the study design, etc.). When the mechanistic data are integrated with findings from previous evaluations of human and animal evidence streams, the totality of evidence does not support CHDs as a critical effect in TCE human health risk assessment.},

Increasingly, oxygen limited biodegradation is being included in petroleum vapor intrusion (PVI) guidance for risk assessment at leaking underground storage tank sites. The application of PVI risk screening tools is aided by the knowledge of subslab oxygen conditions, which, however, are not commonly measured during site investigations. Here we introduce an algebraically explicit analytical method that can estimate oxygen conditions beneath the building slab, for PVI scenarios with impervious or pervious building foundations. Simulation results by this new model are then used to illustrate the role of site-specific conditions in determining the oxygen replenishment below the building for both scenarios. Furthermore, critical slab-width-to-source-depth ratios and critical source depths for the establishment of a subslab ``oxygen shadow'' (i.e. anoxic zone below the building) are provided as a function of key parameters such as vapor source concentration, effective diffusion coefficients of concrete and building depth. For impervious slab scenarios the obtained results are shown in good agreement with findings by previous studies and further support the recommendation by U.S. EPA about the inapplicability of vertical exclusion distances for scenarios involving large buildings and high source concentrations. For pervious slabs, results by this new model indicate that even relatively low effective diffusion coefficients of concrete can facilitate the oxygen transport into the subsurface below the building and create oxygenated conditions below the whole slab foundation favorable for petroleum vapor biodegradation.},

  abstract = {In this study, we investigate the soil gas concentration attenuation with diffusive transport in lateral and vertical transport in cases with surface pavements with a pilot-scale tank. Three scenarios were investigated, one with a completely open soil surface and the other two involving partially paved soil surface. The results, on the one hand, indicate that the soil gas concentration generally decreases linearly and exponentially in the vertical and horizontal transport directions, respectively, generally in accordance with available modeling studies. On the other hand, our experiment shows that low-permeability ground covers can increase shallow soil gas concentrations beneath the pavement by at most 3-4 times, inducing higher subslab concentration than that below open ground surface, even if the latter is obtained at a closer location to vapor source. For cases with uniform soil properties, our study suggests exterior soil gas sample should be taken at a depth below the building foundation by half of the building footprint size, if the vapor source is laterally extensive relative to the building footprint, or by 1\,m and 2-3\,m for slab-on-grade and basement scenarios, respectively, if the vapor source is located laterally away from the building.},

  abstract = {The partition and effective diffusion coefficients of formaldehyde were measured for three materials (conventional gypsum wallboard, ``green'' gypsum wallboard, and ``green'' carpet) under three relative humidity (RH) conditions (20\%, 50\%, and 70\% RH). The ``green'' materials contained recycled materials and were friendly to environment. A dynamic dual-chamber test method was used. Results showed that a higher relative humidity led to a larger effective diffusion coefficient for two kinds of wallboards and carpet. The carpet was also found to be very permeable resulting in an effective diffusion coefficient at the same order of magnitude with the formaldehyde diffusion coefficient in air. The partition coefficient (K ma) of formaldehyde in conventional wallboard was 1.52 times larger at 50\% RH than at 20\% RH, whereas it decreased slightly from 50\% to 70\% RH, presumably due to the combined effects of water solubility of formaldehyde and micro-pore blocking by condensed moisture at the high RH level. The partition coefficient of formaldehyde increased slightly with the increase of relative humidity in ``green'' wallboard and ``green'' carpet. At the same relative humidity level, the ``green'' wallboard had larger partition coefficient and effective diffusion coefficient than the conventional wallboard, presumably due to the micro-pore structure differences between the two materials. The data generated could be used to assess the sorption effects of formaldehyde on building materials and to evaluate its impact on the formaldehyde concentration in buildings. Implications: Based on the results of this study, the sink effects of these commonly used materials (conventional and ``green'' gypsum wallboards, ``green'' carpet) on indoor formaldehyde concentration could be estimated. The effects of relative humidity on the diffusion and partition coefficients of formaldehyde were found to differ for materials and for different humidity levels, indicating the need for further investigation of the mechanisms through which humidity effects take place.},

Since its introduction about twenty years ago, the J-E model has become a cornerstone in guidance related to the potential for significant vapor intrusion-related exposures. A few papers have been published that claim it is a conservative predictor of exposure, but there has not been a systematic comparison in the open literature of the J-E model predictions with the results of more complete full three-dimensional descriptions of the phenomenon. In this paper, predictions from a three-dimensional model of vapor intrusion, based upon finite element calculations of homogeneous soil scenarios, are directly compared with the results of the J-E model. These results suggest that there are conditions under which the J-E model predictions might be quite reasonable but that there are also others in which the predictions are low as well as high. Some small modifications to the J-E model are also suggested that can bring its predictions into excellent agreement with those of the much more elaborate 3-D models, in some specific cases of homogeneous soils. Finally, both models were compared with actual field data.},

In this study, we made a full comparison of the results returned by PVI2D and those obtained using Abreu and Johnson's three-dimensional numerical model (AJM). These comparisons, examined as a function of the source strength, source depth, and reaction rate constant, show that PVI2D can provide similar soil gas concentration profiles and source-to-indoor air attenuation factors (within one order of magnitude difference) as those by the AJM. The differences between the two models can be ascribed to some simplifying assumptions used in PVI2D and to some numerical limitations of the AJM in simulating strictly piecewise aerobic biodegradation and no-flux boundary conditions. Overall, the obtained results show that for cases involving homogenous source and soil, PVI2D can represent a valid alternative to more rigorous three-dimensional numerical models.},

A simple alternative to the widely-used but restrictive one-dimensional (1-D) screening models is presented and justified by comparing to predictions from a three-dimensional (3-D) CFD model. A series of simulations were prepared for steady-state transport of a non-biodegradable contaminant in homogenous soil for different structure construction features and site characteristics. The results showed that subslab concentration does not strongly depend on the soil diffusivity, indoor air pressure, or foundation footprint size. It is determined by the geometry of the domain, represented by a characteristic length which is the ratio of foundation depth to source depth. An extension of this analytical approximation was developed for multi-layer soil cases.},

The method involves combining an analytic approximation to soil vapor transport with a piecewise first-order biodegradation model (together called the Analytic Approximation Method, including Biodegradation, AAMB), the result of which calculation provides an estimate of contaminant subslab concentrations, independent of building operation conditions. Comparisons with three-dimensional (3-D) simulations and another PVI screening tool, BioVapor, show that the AAMB is suitable for application in a scenario involving a building with an impermeable foundation surrounded by open ground surface, where the atmosphere is regarded as the primary oxygen source. Predictions from the AAMB can be used to determine the required vertical source-building separation, given a subslab screening concentration, allowing identification of buildings at risk for PVI. This equation shows that the ``vertical screening distance'' suggested by U.S. EPA is sufficient in most cases, as long as the total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) soil gas concentration at the vapor source does not exceed 50\textendash{}100mg/L. When the TPH soil gas concentration of the vapor source approaches a typical limit, i.e. 400mg/L, the ``vertical screening distance'' required would be much greater.},

  abstract = {In 2002, U.S. EPA proposed a general buffer zone of approximately 100 feet (30m) laterally to determine which buildings to include in vapor intrusion (VI) investigations. However, this screening distance can be threatened by factors such as extensive surface pavements. Under such circumstances, EPA recommended investigating soil vapor migration distance on a site-specific basis. To serve this purpose, we present an analytical model (AAMLPH) as an alternative to estimate lateral VI screening distances at chlorinated compound-contaminated sites. Based on a previously introduced model (AAML), AAMLPH is developed by considering the effects of impervious surface cover and soil geology heterogeneities, providing predictions consistent with the three-dimensional (3-D) numerical simulated results. By employing risk-based and contribution-based screening levels of subslab concentrations (50 and 500{$\mu$}g/m3, respectively) and source-to-subslab attenuation factor (0.001 and 0.01, respectively), AAMLPH suggests that buildings greater than 30m from a plume boundary can still be affected by VI in the presence of any two of the three factors, which are high source vapor concentration, shallow source and significant surface cover. This finding justifies the concern that EPA has expressed about the application of the 30 m lateral separation distance in the presence of physical barriers (e.g., asphalt covers or ice) at the ground surface.},

This new model accounts for both advective and diffusive transport in soil gas and couples this with a piecewise first-order aerobic biodegradation model, limited by oxygen availability. The predicted results from the new model are shown to be in good agreement with the simulation results obtained from a three-dimensional numerical model. These results suggest that this analytical model is suitable for describing cases involving open ground surface beyond the foundation edge, serving as the primary oxygen source. This new analytical model indicates that the major contribution of upward advection to indoor air concentration could be limited to the increase of soil gas entry rate, since the oxygen in soil might already be depleted owing to the associated high methane source vapor concentration.},

Contaminant biodegradation must often also be included in this simulation, and can increase the difficulty of obtaining a solution, especially when explicitly considering coupled oxygen transport and consumption. The models of contaminant building entry pathway are often coupled to calculations of indoor air contaminant concentration, and both are influenced by building construction and operational features. The description of entry pathway involves consideration of building foundation characteristics, while calculation of indoor air contaminant levels requires characterization of building enclosed space and air exchange within this.

However, few studies have systematically investigated the influence on vapor intrusion predictions of slab crack features, such as the shape and distribution of slab cracks and related to this overall building foundation footprint size. In this paper, predictions from a three-dimensional model of vapor intrusion are used to compare the contaminant mass flow rates into buildings with different foundation slab crack features. The simulations show that the contaminant mass flow rate into the building does not change much for different assumed slab crack shapes and locations, and the foundation footprint size does not play a significant role in determining contaminant mass flow rate through a unit area of crack. Moreover, the simulation helped reveal the distribution of subslab contaminant soil vapor concentration beneath the foundation, and the results suggest that in most cases involving no biodegradation, the variation in subslab concentration should not exceed an order of magnitude, and is often significantly less than this.},

  abstract = {In this study we present an analytical solution of a two-dimensional petroleum vapor intrusion model, which incorporates a steady-state diffusion-dominated vapor transport in a homogeneous soil and piecewise first-order aerobic biodegradation limited by oxygen availability. This new model can help practitioners to easily generate two-dimensional soil gas concentration profiles for both hydrocarbons and oxygen and estimate hydrocarbon indoor air concentrations as a function of site-specific conditions such as source strength and depth, reaction rate constant, soil characteristics and building features. The soil gas concentration profiles generated by this new model are shown in good agreement with three-dimensional numerical simulations and two-dimensional measured soil gas data from a field study. This implies that for cases involving diffusion dominated soil gas transport, steady state conditions and homogenous source and soil, this analytical model can be used as a fast and easy-to-use risk screening tool by replicating the results of 3-D numerical simulations but with much less computational effort.},

  abstract = {In this work, we present an analytical chlorinated vapor intrusion (CVI) model that can estimate source-to-indoor air concentration attenuation by simulating two-dimensional (2-D) vapor concentration profile in vertically heterogeneous soils overlying a homogenous vapor source. The analytical solution describing the 2-D soil gas transport was obtained by applying a modified Schwarz-Christoffel mapping method. A partial field validation showed that the developed model provides results (especially in terms of indoor emission rates) in line with the measured data from a case involving a building overlying a layered soil. In further testing, it was found that the new analytical model can very closely replicate the results of three-dimensional (3-D) numerical models at steady state in scenarios involving layered soils overlying homogenous groundwater sources. By contrast, by adopting a two-layer approach (capillary fringe and vadose zone) as employed in the EPA implementation of the Johnson and Ettinger model, the spatially and temporally averaged indoor concentrations in the case of groundwater sources can be higher than the ones estimated by the numerical model up to two orders of magnitude. In short, the model proposed in this work can represent an easy-to-use tool that can simulate the subsurface soil gas concentration in layered soils overlying a homogenous vapor source while keeping the simplicity of an analytical approach that requires much less computational effort.},

  abstract = {In many urban settings, groundwater contains volatile organic compounds, such as tricholoroethene, tetrachloroethene, benzene, etc., at concentrations that are at or slightly below non-potable groundwater standards. Some non-potable groundwater standards do not protect against human health risks that might result from vapor intrusion. Vapor intrusion is a process by which vapor phase contaminants present in the subsurface migrate through the soil and ultimately enter a building through foundation cracks. The end result is a decrease in air quality within the building. Predicting whether or not vapor intrusion will occur at rates sufficient to cause health risks is extremely difficult and depends on many factors. In many cities, a wide-range of property uses take place over a relatively small area. For instance, schools, commercial buildings and residential buildings may all reside within a few city blocks. Most conceptual site models assume the ground surface is open to the atmosphere (i.e. green space); however the effect that an impervious surface (e.g. paving) may have on vapor transport rates is not routinely considered. Using a 3-D computational fluid dynamics model, we are investigating how the presence of impervious surfaces affects vapor intrusion rates. To complement our modelling efforts, we are in the initial stages of conducting a field study in a neighborhood where vapor intrusion is occurring.},

  abstract = {The basis upon which recommended attenuation factors for vapor intrusion (VI) have been derived are reconsidered. By making a fitting curve to the plot showing the dependence of observed indoor air concentration (cin) on subslab concentration (css) for residences in EPA database, an analytical equation is obtained to identify the relationship among cin, css and the averaged background level. The new relationship indicates that subslab measurements may serve as a useful guide only if css is above 500{$\mu$}g/m3. Otherwise, cin is independent of css, with a distribution in good agreements with other studies of background levels. Therefore, employing this screening value (500{$\mu$}g/m3), new contaminant concentration attenuation factors are proposed for VI, and the values for groundwater-to-indoor and subslab-to-indoor air concentration attenuation factors are 0.004 and 0.02, respectively. The former is applied to examining the reported temporal variations of cin obtained during a long-term monitoring study. The results show that using this new groundwater-to-indoor air concentration attenuation factor also provides a reasonably conservative estimate of cin.},
