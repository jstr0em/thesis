\chapter*{Abstract}

The significant temporal variability of vapor intrusion (VI) complicate site investigations and increase the chances of over- or underestimating human exposure to indoor air contaminants.
Conducting longer and more temporally high-resolution studies of suspected VI sites is one way to address this issue.
However, this approach is undesirable as these types of studies can be more technically difficult and present significant costs.
Improving our understanding of the factors that influence this temporal variability is therefore essential for accurate assessment of human exposure to these contaminants.\par

The scarcity of
