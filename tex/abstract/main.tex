\chapter*{Abstract}

Human exposure to indoor pollutants has for long been a concern and vapor intrusion - typically thought of as the migration of contaminants from soil or groundwater, is a relatively recent addition to these concerns.
Vapor intrusion has been found to exhibit significant temporal variability, complicating site investigations.
To improve the characterization of human exposure to vapor intrusion contaminants the causes of the temporal variability must be better understood.\par

Due to the costs and difficulties of performing the long-term and high-resolution investigations required to understand temporal variability of VI.
Over the years a few such investigations have been undertaken and are their datasets are indispensable for achieving this.
However, the complexity of these datasets present both opportunities and complications for elucidating the temporal variability.\par

Three-dimensional numerical modeling of vapor intrusion informed by these data presents an


% Ok the above is a farcry from "simple" English and not specific enough.
