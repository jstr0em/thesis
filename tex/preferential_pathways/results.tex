contrasting\section{Temporal Variability And Preferential Pathways}

In the calculation results shown in Figure \ref{fig:model_results}, a preferential pathway is assumed to provide air containing contaminant vapor at a concentration equivalent to the vapor in equilibrium with the underlying groundwater source.
Here, the indoor air exchange rate $A_e$ was assumed to be a constant 0.5 per hour, and $p_\mathrm{in/out}$ was varied from -5 to 5 Pa.
Values of predicted indoor air contaminant concentrations, $c_\mathrm{in}$ were obtained from steady state calculations.
The predicted $c_\mathrm{in}$ values were then normalized by the assumed vapor concentration in equilibrium with groundwater $c_\mathrm{gw}$, giving the attenuation from groundwater $\alpha_\mathrm{gw}$.
The predicted values of $\alpha_\mathrm{gw}$ as a function of $p_\mathrm{in/out}$ are given by the solid line Figure \ref{fig:model_results}.
These predicted values are compared to actual measured $\alpha_\mathrm{gw}$ values from the ASU House for the period during which the preferential pathway was open given by the blue points.\par

  \caption{Model predicted indoor air concentration (as groundwater attenuation) compared to values recorded at the ASU house. The modeling results are given the solid lines and data by the dots. Blue here represents data before the closing of the preferential pathway and modeling result from the corresponding model, i.e. the model features a preferential pathway and a gravel sub-base. The green color signifies data from the period after the closing of the preferential pathway with the corresponding model, i.e. the preferential pathway is removed but the gravel sub-base remains. Here the data is placed in 20 equally \textit{spaced bin}, i.e. not equally \textit{sized}. The dot is the mean value and the error bars represent the 95\% confidence intervals.}
  \label{fig:model_results}
\end{figure}

The model successfully predicts the observed trends in $\alpha_\mathrm{gw}$ as $p_\mathrm{in/out}$ decreases (increased depressurization) but somewhat underpredicts $\alpha_\mathrm{gw}$ as the house is overpressurized.
Most significantly, the model captures that even for a small increase in depressurization (0 to -5 Pa) a very large increase in $\alpha_\mathrm{gw}$ (two order of magnitude) can occur.\par

The model is also able to capture the weak trend in $\alpha_\mathrm{gw}$ with $p_\mathrm{in/out}$ when a preferential pathway is absent, but when there still exists a permeable subslab region.
These results given by the green line in Figure \ref{fig:model_results}.  
These results are again in agreement with what was observed at the ASU House when the preferential pathway was closed, i.e. that there was a much more modest variation in indoor air concentration, irrespective of pressure, when the preferential pathway was cut off.\par

This shows the significant contribution that such a preferential pathway may have at a VI site.
First, the preferential pathway acts not only as a source of contaminant vapor, but also  as a source of air to the subslab.
Because of the large resistance to soil gas flow in the surrounding soil, having a local source of air to support the increase of advective flow into the structure from the subslab region makes a large difference.\par

While there obviously is still some variability unaccounted for, as indicated by the error bars in Figure \ref{fig:model_results}, we can say with some confidence that the model is able to capture the general influence of such a preferential pathway.
This opens us up to explore some of the factors that may be crucial for such an influence.
Using our model, we rerun some of the scenarios, but this time consider two more cases:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item We remove the gravel sub-base layer but keep the preferential pathway.
  \item We keep the gravel sub-base layer, but remove contaminant vapor from the preferential pathway, i.e. it contains "clean" air.
\end{enumerate}
The results of running these cases can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:model_cases}.\par

\begin{figure}[htb!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{modeling_cases.pdf}
  \caption{How different cases affect the predicted impact of the preferential pathway. The effect of removing the gravel sub-base, as well as a clean-air containing preferential pathway are considered.}
  \label{fig:model_cases}
\end{figure}

Here the original modeling results and associated data from the period before the closing of the preferential pathway is again given by blue
The case corresponding to the removal of contaminant vapors from the preferential pathway case is given by the green line, while the removal of the gravel sub-base care is given by red.\par

The removal of contaminant vapors from the preferential pathway largely eliminates the significant increase of $\alpha_\mathrm{gw}$ with respect to $p_\mathrm{in}$ as given by blue in Figure \ref{fig:model_results}.
However, the increase is larger than when the preferential pathway was absent as indicated by green in Figure \ref{fig:model_results}.
This shows that a preferential pathway similar to the one found at the ASU house does two things.\par

First, it provides a preferential source of air, and the depressurized building is able to much easier draw air from the preferential pathway than the surrounding soil; the soil offers a huge resistance to airflow and thus advective transport.
Second, the increase in "advective potential" is inadequate to cause the same sort of effect as observed at the ASU house, and a preferential source of contaminant vapors is also required - two conditions that were seemingly fulfilled at the ASU house.\par

The removal of the gravel sub-base likewise also has a significant effect on the modeling results, and without it the full potential of a preferential pathway is seemingly unrealized.
This can again be understood by understanding the significant resistance to contaminant transport that soils can present.
This adds a third condition for such a preferential pathways influence - a medium for effective communication between the preferential pathway and indoor environment is necessary.\par

This can be shown by analyzing the Péclet number for transport through the foundation crack.
The Péclet number is a dimensionless number defined as the ratio between advective and diffusive transport across some characteristic length, i.e. it tell us if transport is advective or diffusion dominated.
For transport through the foundation crack we define this as
\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{Pe} = \frac{\mathrm{advection}}{\mathrm{diffusion}} = \frac{u_\mathrm{ck} L_\mathrm{slab}}{D_\mathrm{g}}
\end{equation}
here $u_\mathrm{ck}$ [\si{\metre\per\second}] is the airflow velocity across through the crackl
$L_\mathrm{slab} = \SI{15}{\centi\metre}$ is the thickness of the foundation slab, i.e. the characteristic length;
and $D_g = \SI{6.87e-6}{\metre\squared\per\second}$ is the diffusivity of TCE in pure air.\par

\begin{figure}[htb!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{modeling_result_peclet.pdf}
  \caption{Péclet number for transport through the foundation crack of our modeled house as a fucntion of building pressurization. Here we consider three cases where the preferential pathway and gravel sub-base are present/absent, which shows the dramatic effect these site features can have on contaminant transport at a VI site.}
  \label{fig:peclet_number}
\end{figure}

The value of $\mathrm{Pe}$ charcterizes transport as such:
\begin{align*}
  &\mathrm{Pe} \gg 1 & \text{Advection dominated} \\
  &\mathrm{Pe} \ll 1 & \text{Diffusion dominated} \\
  &\mathrm{Pe} = 1 & \text{Advection and diffusion equal}
\end{align*}
Figure \ref{fig:peclet_number} shows the Péclet number for three of the modeled cases:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Preferential pathway and gravel sub-base layer present
  \item Preferential pathway present but gravel sub-base layer absent
  \item Preferential pathway absent but gravel sub-base layer present
\end{enumerate}
Note that the cases when $p_\mathrm{in} > \SI{0}{\pascal}$ are not plotted, as the only different is the sign of the Péclet number - by our definition $u_\mathrm{ck} > 0$ indicates airflow into the house.
This figure shows that it is only through the combination of a preferential pathway and a gravel sub-base layer that advective transport is able to dominate; diffusive transport dominates for the other cases which explains the weak correlation between $\alpha_\mathrm{gw}$ and $p_\mathrm{in}$ in Figure \ref{fig:model_cases} when the preferential pathway was removed.
Likewise it explains the dramatic increase of $\alpha_\mathrm{gw}$ as $p_\mathrm{in}$ decreases when the  gravel sub-base and preferential pathway were present, as advective transport only starts to dominate after $p_\mathrm{in} < \SI{-2.5}{\pascal}$.\par


To summarize, for a preferential pathway to have a significant influence at a VI site, the following conditions need to be fulfilled:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A preferential source of air in required to enhance the advective transport potential at the site.
  \item Contaminant vapors must likewise be preferentially supplied.
  \item There needs to exist a medium to facilitate effective communication between the preferential pathway and the indoor environment.
\end{enumerate}
While this may seem like some specific conditions to be fulfilled for a preferential pathway to be so impactful, it can easily be generalized to other scenarios.
For instance, one could easily imagine a situation where a house has a gravel backfill surrounding it, with some other subsurface source - like a leaky sewer pipe (that does not exit anywhere the building).
Under such a circumstance, one could conceivably observe a similar effect in the indoor contaminant concentration caused by a very different scenario.\par

\subsection{Role Of Air Exchange Rate}

Simulations so far has assumed that air exchange rate is at a constant \SI{0.5}{\per\hour} irrespective of the house pressurization.
This is not quite realistic, as air exchange rates are constantly fluctuating, and this will have an impact on indoor contaminant concentrations.
To account for this, we will again rerun our model simulations, but this time assuming different air exchange rate values, and if this can capture some more of the observed variability.\par

Ideally, we would wish to be able to determine air exchange rate based on site conditions, and in particular building pressurization.
Determining air exchange rate exactly is difficult, and is influenced by building pressurization, indoor/outdoor temperature differences, wind, operation of HVAC systems, etc.
This is a topic that will be expanded on in Chapter (TBD).\par % TODO Reference chapter

Air exchange rates are usually legally regulated as part of local building ordinances, and depending on the type of building, its values and bounds are usually more or less known.
Instead, we will rerun the model and assume a wider range of constant air exchange rate values.
At the ASU house, air exchange rates were measured using a tracer-gas study, and the the \nth{10}, \nth{50}, and \nth{90} percentile air exchange rate values, as well as the corresponding values from the EPA duplex, and an independent EPA study that measured air exchange rates nationwide in the USA, all of which can be seen in Table \ref{tbl:air_exchange_rate}.
Based on this we will rerun the model using air exchange values of 0.1, 0.5, and \SI{0.9}{\per\hour}.\par

\end{table}

Figure \ref{fig:model_results_air_exchange_rate} shows the result of incorporating a wider range of air exchange rates when predicting $\alpha_\mathrm{gw}$.
Here the central lines are the result corresponding to $A_e = \SI{0.5}{\per\hour}$, while the upper and lower bounds of each shaded area correspond to $A_e = 0.1$ and \SI{0.9}{\per\hour} respectively.
The shaded area cover much of the confidence interval of $\alpha_\mathrm{gw}$ as a function of $p_\mathrm{in}$
This indicates that much of the uncertainty of numerically determining $\alpha_\mathrm{gw}$ could be accounted for by considering the range of air exchange values at a site; a "numerical confidence interval" of sorts.\par

\begin{figure}[htb!]

  \label{fig:model_results_air_exchange_rate}
\end{figure}

This concept of using pressure and air exchange rate is applied to a transient simulation, where we try to model a "typical" day by using the median diurnal variation of $p_\mathrm{in}$ and $A_e$ are used as model inputs, where we consider our model with and without the preferential pathway present.
Specifically, we will use the median diurnal values of $p_\mathrm{in}$ and $A_e$ at one hour intervals over a 24-hour period from the ASU house and interpolating using cubic splines between these for continuity.
This will be put into contrast for a case where we only use the median diurnal values of $p_\mathrm{in}$ but keep $A = \SI{0.5}{\per\hour}$ constant.\par

Figure \ref{fig:model_diurnal} shows how $\alpha_\mathrm{gw}$ varies throughout this hypothetical "typical" day.
Here we see that when the preferential pathway is present, variability of $\alpha_\mathrm{gw}$ is mostly driven by fluctuations in contaminant entry rate; the variable and constant air exchange rate cases do not differ much from each other.
When the preferential pathway is absent, then there is no variability of $\alpha_\mathrm{gw}$ unless the air exchange rate is fluctuating.\par

\begin{figure}[htb!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{modeling_diurnal.pdf}
  \caption{Modeled indoor contaminant concentration (as attenuation from groundwater) over a "typical" day. Here the hourly median indoor/outdoor pressure difference and air exchange rates recorded at the ASU house, as well as a comparison case where a constant air exchange rate of \SI{0.5}{\per\hour} is assumed, are used as model input parameters. For these we consider two models cases; one where a preferential pathway is present and absent respectively.}
  \label{fig:model_diurnal}
\end{figure}

To quantify the predicted variability of $\alpha_\mathrm{gw}$ we define ratio between the minimum and maximum $\alpha_\mathrm{gw}$ as
\begin{equation}
  \Delta_\mathrm{max} = \frac{\alpha_\mathrm{gw,max}}{\alpha_\mathrm{gw,min}}
\end{equation}
Applying this to the cases where air exchange rate is varied, and the preferential pathway present/absent we find that these ratios are $\Delta_\mathrm{max} = 5.09$ and $\Delta_\mathrm{max} = 1.68$ respectively.
I.e. $\alpha_\mathrm{gw}$ may be expected to vary around half an order of magnitude at site characterized by a preferential pathway under our considered conditions, whereas one where there is no preferential pathway may vary by a factor of 1.68.\par

These "maximum daily variability" $\Delta_\mathrm{max}$ values can be compared to those at the ASU house.
Indoor contaminant concentration samples at the ASU house were collected roughly every four hours across the study period.
By excluding the CPM period, and then resampling these data on a daily basis, we can find $\Delta_\mathrm{max}$ for each day.
These data are further separated to consider the period before and after the land drain preferential pathway was closed.
The period before the preferential pathway was closed then includes 441 days or data points, giving a median value $\Delta_\mathrm{max} = 2.33$.
For the period after the preferential pathway was closed, we get 181 days of data, giving a median value of $\Delta_\mathrm{max} = 1.60$.
Thus, we can see that we somewhat overpredicted the expected variability for the period when the preferential pathway was open, but quite close when it was closed.\par

This indicates that for sites that are characterized by diffusive transport, much of the observed variability of indoor contaminant concentrations are driven by fluctuations in air exchange rate.
For sites dominated by advective transport, fluctuations in building pressurization, and subsequently contaminant entry, are more important drivers are temporal variability of $\alpha_\mathrm{gw}$.\par
