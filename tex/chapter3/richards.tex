\subsection{Water Flow in Unsaturated Porous Media}\label{sec:richards}

The vadose zone or unsaturated zone is a region of soil between the top of the ground surface and the water table.
In the vadose zone there are two fluid phases, one gas and the other liquid (usually air and water) inside the porous soil matrix giving a three phase system; only one fluid phase (gas or liquid) exist in the saturated zone.
As a result, the transport properties in the vadose zone differ from that in a zone saturated where there are only two phases present - water and soil.\par



\subsubsection{Soil-Water Potential}

The driving force, or soil-water potential, for the filling and draining of pore water in soils are due to a pressure and a gravitational potential and given by $\phi$.


The driving force for the pore water in the vadose zone is a negative pressure caused by the surface tension of the water.
This phenomena is called \textit{capillary potential} or \textit{matrix potential}, $\psi$, which depends on the volumetric water content $\theta$ in the soil.

\subsubsection{Richard's Equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:richards}
  \rho \Big( \frac{C_m}{\rho g} + \mathrm{Se}S \Big) \frac{\partial p}{\partial t} +
  \nabla \cdot \rho \Big( -\frac{\kappa_s}{\mu} k_r (\nabla p + \rho g \nabla D)\Big) =
  Q_m
\end{equation}
Where $p$ is the capillary potential; $C_m$ is the specific moisture capacity; $\mathrm{Se}$ is the effective saturation; $S$ is the storage coefficient; $\kappa_s$ is the saturated permeability of the porous media; $\mu$ is the fluid viscosity; $k_r$ is the effective permeability; $\rho$ is the fluid density; $g$ is the acceleration of gravity; $D$ is the elevation or head; and $Q_m$ is a source term, a positive or negative value represent a source or sink respectively.\par
