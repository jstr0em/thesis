\subsection{Vapor Transport in Unsaturated Porous Media}\label{sec:darcys}

Fluid transport in porous media is governed by \textit{Darcy's Law} and was originally formulated by Henry Darcy based on his work on describing water flow through soil under the influence of gravity.
Since then it been found to derivable in several ways from the Navier-Stokes equations\cite{bear_dynamics_1972} and may be stated as a pressure gradient driven velocity.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:darcys_law_saturated}
  \vec{u} = -\frac{\kappa}{\mu}\nabla p
\end{equation}
Here $\vec{u}$ is the fluid velocity; $\kappa$ the soil permeability; $\mu$ is the fluid viscosity; and $\nabla p$ is the pressure gradient.
In VI modeling we're interested in the flow of contaminant vapors but since the contaminant concentrations are typically very low, the transport properties may be taken from those of pure air.\par

% TODO: Elaborate on the assumptions, i.e. that in DL the viscosity shear effects may be neglected. But this breaks down when Re is too high.

For Darcy's Law to be valid, two assumptions must be fulfilled:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The fluid must be in the laminar regime, typically $\mathrm{Re} < 1$.
  \item The soil matrix must be saturated with the fluid.
\end{enumerate}
Typically the vapor flows in most VI scenarios are sufficiently slow for the first condition to be fulfilled.
And if they are not, there are modifications to Darcy's Law that
Most of the contaminant vapor transport takes place in the partially saturated vadose zone and thus, \eqref{eq:darcys_law_saturated} needs modification.

In partially saturated soils, a varying portion of the soil pores are available for vapor transport, with the rest being occupied by water, affecting the effective permeability of the soil.
To model this, a relative permeability property, $k_r$, is introduced:
\begin{equation}
  \kappa_\mathrm{eff} = k_r \kappa_s
\end{equation}
$k_r$ is a dimensionless parameter that varies between 0 and 1, and $\kappa_s$ is the saturated, or simply the soil matrix permeability.

This gives the modified Darcy's Law used in VI-modeling:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:darcys_law}
  \vec{u} = -\frac{k_r \kappa_s}{\mu}\nabla p
\end{equation}
