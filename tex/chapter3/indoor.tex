The fundamental assumption of a CSTR is that any contaminant or chemical species entering, or inside the indoor air space (control volume), is perfectly mixed, i.e. there are no spatial gradients.

The indoor air space
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cst}
  V\frac{\partial c}{\partial t} = n - V A_e c + R
\end{equation}
Here $n$ is the contaminant entry rate into the building, $A_e$ is the air exchange rate, which determines the rate at which indoor contaminants are expelled, and $R$ can be the generation of contaminant vapor from an indoor source or sorption.
