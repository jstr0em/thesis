What do I want people to know after reading this?

* Modeling is useful because it allows us to understand the physical causes of VI in great detail. It also lets use explore different scenarios.

* Some basic background about VI, such as a brief history of it and indoor air quality (Radon etc).

* What are the current hot topics in VI?
- ITS
- CPM

* Why is temporal and spatial variability a problem in VI?
